<h1>Basbousa</h1>
<p>'Basbousa (Arabic: بسبوسة‎) is a traditional Middle Eastern sweet cake. Coconut is a popular addition. The syrup may also optionally contain orange flower water or rose water.</p>
<h2>Names </h2>
<p>Basbousa has many regional and dialect names (Arabic: بسبوسة basbūsah, هريسة harīsa, and nammoura (in Lebanon), French: gabelouze, kalbelouz, and qualb-el-louz (in Tunisian French), Greek: ραβανί and ρεβανί).</p>
<p>It is found in the cuisines of the Middle East,the Balkans and the Horn of Africa under a variety of names. It appears to be a variant of the Egyptian dish ma'mounia.[citation needed] In southern Greece, it is called ravani, while in the north, it is called revani. Basbousa is often called "hareesa" in Jordan, the Maghreb, and the Egyptian city of Alexandria.[citation needed] Basbousa is a particularly popular dessert among Coptic Christians for fasts, such as Great Lent and the Nativity Fast as it is vegetarian.[citation needed]</p>
