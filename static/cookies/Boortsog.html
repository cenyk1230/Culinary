<h1>Boortsog</h1>
<p>Boortsog, boorsoq, bauyrsaq, or baursak (Bashkir: бауырһаҡ, Kazakh: бауырсақ [bɑwərsɑ́q], Kyrgyz: боорсок [boːrsóq], Mongolian: боорцог [ˈpɔːrtsʰəq], Russian: баурсак, Tatar: Cyrillic бавырсак, Latin bawırsaq, Uzbek: bog'irsoq [bɒʁɨrsɒ́q], Tajik: бусроқ [busrɒ́q], Turkish: pişi, bişi, tuzlu lokma, halka, Turkmen: pişme) is a type of fried dough food found in the cuisines of Central Asia, Idel-Ural, and Mongolia. Tajik boortsog are often decorated with a criss-cross pattern by pressing the bottom of a small strainer on the dough before it is fried.</p>
<p>Boortsog is often eaten as a dessert, with sugar, butter, or honey. They may be thought of as cookies or biscuits, and since they are fried, they are sometimes compared to doughnuts. Mongolians and other Turkic peoples sometimes dip boortsog in tea. In Central Asia, baursaki are often eaten alongside chorba.</p>
<h2>Preparation </h2>
<p>Dough for Boortsog ranges in ingredients from a simple dough, to a sweeter, crispier dough. For example, a typical Kyrgyz recipe calls for one part butter, 7 parts salt water, and 6 parts milk, along with yeast and flour, while more complex recipes add eggs and sugar.</p>
<p>Boortsog are made by cutting the flattened dough into pieces. While not usually done in Central Asia, these pieces may be bent and knotted into various shapes before being deep fried. This is especially common among Mongolians. The dough is deep-fried golden brown. Mutton fat is traditionally used by Mongolians to give the boortsog extra flavor, but vegetable oil may be substituted.</p>
