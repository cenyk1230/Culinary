<h2>Mazurek tradition </h2>
<p>The mazurek's name might have originated from the word Mazur (or Masurian) tribe inhabiting the Mazovia region of central Poland, or perhaps from the word mazurek (Polish for mazurka), traditional folk dance in triple metre from Poland.</p>
<p>Although considered uniquely Polish, almost a seasonal national dessert,</p>
<p>Mazurek was entered onto the list of Polish traditional dessert products for the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship by the Ministry of Rural Development on 3 November 2011, described in a particular way. It is supposed to be rectangular, 20 centimetres (7.9in) by 40 centimetres (16in) in size, very sweet with distinct aroma of walnuts, golden or golden-brown in color, considerably flat, with shortcrust base prepared separately, and thick layer of icing decorated with dried fruit and nuts into a pattern.</p>
