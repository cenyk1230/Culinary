<h1>Cannabis foods</h1>
<p>Cannabis foods (including hash brownies, pot brownies and space cakes (also known as happy cake)), more informally known as edibles, are food products made with cannabis in herbal or resin form as an ingredient. They are consumed as an alternate delivery means to experience the effects of cannabinoids without smoking or vaporizing cannabis or hashish. Instead, the cannabinoids are put into cake, cookie, brownie, or other foods, and are consumed for recreational or medicinal purposes.</p>
<h2>Nomenclature </h2>
<p>There are many different names and slang terms for the recipes. Prefixes such as edibles, hash, cannabis, weed, space, cosmic, freaky, magic, special, enhanced, medicated, fabricated, buffed, stimulated, stimmed, superskunk, spiked, evolved, fortified, jumped, flight, locker are added to the name of the food that they are prepared with: "hash cakes," "special brownies" etc.</p>
<h2>Ingredients and effects </h2>
<p>Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is generally considered to be the primary active substance in cannabis. Along with other psychoactive cannabinoids, THC is a hydrophobic oil, meaning it is insoluble in water but soluble in lipids (oil/fat) and alcohol. Using either one of these to extract THC from cannabis is required to have the cooked product be psychoactive.</p>
<p>The oil-solubility of cannabis extracts has been known since ancient times, when Sanskrit recipes from India required that the cannabis be sautéed in ghee before mixing it with other ingredients. Making a tea by boiling cannabis in water is a highly inefficient way to extract cannabinoids, although if the cannabis is of good quality and has plenty of resin on the outside, a portion of resin can be softened by the heat and float out into the water. Adding milk (which contains fat, water, proteins and electrolytes as well as certain sugars) when steeping, however, makes it much more efficient than using plain water, and this technique has been used for thousands of years in India to make the drink bhang.</p>
<p>Some authors claim that oral consumption of cannabis, when properly cooked, is a more efficient way to absorb cannabinoids than smoking it.</p>
<p>Because oral doses are processed by the liver before entering the bloodstream, oral THC produces high levels of active metabolite 11-OH-THC, while smoked cannabis does not.</p>
<h2>Oil </h2>
<p>"Cannaoils" or "marijuana oils" are cooking oil based products that have been infused with cannabinoids. This is accomplished by performing an extraction of certain chemical constituents from the cannabis plant into the oil through various methods. Ground cannabis plant material must be "activated" by the decarboxylation of (−)-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol acid to (−)-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in order to become a psychoactive compound. This activation process can be done before or during the extraction into oil. A recent research study on the decarboxylation of THC performed by heating ground plant material found the highest yield of psychoactive THC to be achieved at 110 C after 110 minutes. Cannabis cooking oils are available to medical cannabis patients in a variety of organic blends for various cooking applications.</p>
<h2>Butter </h2>
<p>"Magical Butter", "Cannabutter", "butterjuana", or "marijuana butter" is a butter-based solution which has been infused with cannabinoids.]</p>
<h2>Liqueurs </h2>
<p>Because cannabis resins are soluble in alcohol, an effective way of adding them into dishes is through cooking brandy or rum infused with cannabinoids. Generally, stems and leaves of the marijuana plant are used due to their lower THC content when smoked. When infused in high-proof grain-based alcohol (such as Everclear) it becomes what is commonly known as Green Dragon. Creme de Gras (a play on the English "grass", as creme de gras translates literally as "cream of fat") is a flavored liqueur made from cannabis. It can be added to coffee and other beverages.</p>
<h2>Hash cookie </h2>
<p>Hash cookies, also known as space cookies, are bakery products made using one of the forms of cannabis, including hashish.</p>
<p>Hash cookies are essentially the same as marijuana cookies but are more potent. They can be seen in cake, ball, and brownie form as well. To make them, large amounts of hash (typically half a gram to as much as a gram a cookie) are baked into the product in careful steps, so that the user is able to achieve a high without smoking. Some users report that the high is different from smoking, it is usually more powerful and much longer lasting. The high produced by hash products is generally associated with a feeling of lightness, commonly referred to as a "head high". The main benefits to preparing these cookies is that they do not cause the respiratory system harm that smoke does. They can be used in many places where smoking is not convenient, as they can easily be brought to parties, cafés etc. One is not usually able to tell the difference between regular baked goods and those containing drugs before consumption, but they tend to have a slight greenish tinge with marijuana, and they often emit a faint odor. A mild flavor can be detectable if sufficient quantities are used. Many resources for recipes, preparation, and dosage are available online, though they vary greatly in effectiveness and quality.</p>
<p>The writer Alice B. Toklas's inclusion of her friend Brion Gysin's recipe for "Haschich Fudge" in her 1954 literary memoir The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook caused a sensation at the time, and led to her name becoming associated with cannabis food with the use of the phrase "Alice B. Toklas brownies" for many years afterwards.</p>
<p>"Space cakes" is a common name for muffins, brownies, and cookies baked with marijuana, which are very popular in the Netherlands. It used to sometimes be popular to frost these with psilocybin mushroom frosting, but this practice has since been discontinued when psilocybin mushrooms were banned in 2008.</p>
<h2>Cultural influence </h2>
<p>The brownie was used in the 1968 film, I Love You, Alice B. Toklas, in which a character portrayed by Peter Sellers becomes disillusioned with his mainstream life after falling in love with a free spirit, only to become just as disillusioned with the hippie subculture. Marijuana-spiked brownies are a key plot element.</p>
<p>The brownie also plays a major role on That '70s Show, where the gang of kids enjoyed them as snacks and as a source of getting high. Especially in the episode "Garage Sale", where Red (Kurtwood Smith) eats all of Hyde's (Danny Masterson) "special brownies" and sells his son Eric's (Topher Grace) car while under the influence.</p>
<p>It has been featured as a plot device in numerous TV shows, including The Secret Life of the American Teenager, Skins, Hall Pass, Grounded for Life, ("Henry's Working for the Drug Squad"), Arrested Development ("Afternoon Delight"), Taxi, Laverne  Shirley, Barney Miller, Chips, Family Guy, American Dad!, How I Met Your Mother, Desperate Housewives, One Tree Hill, Glee, That 70's Show, Gilmore Girls, The Young and the Restless, Weeds, The L Word, Degrassi: The Next Generation, My Name is Earl, I Love Keith Allen, 90210, Swingtown, The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, Bates Motel and Frasier ("High Holidays"), as well as in movies such as Love and Other Disasters, EuroTrip, Next Friday, Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo, Never Been Kissed, Adventureland, Grandma's Boy, Can't Hardly Wait, Life as We Know It, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and Empire Records. The film Smiley Face is based entirely on a woman who consumes a large amount of cannabis cupcakes. In popular music, the most memorable lyric from the song The Mambo Craze by downtempo jazz group De-Phazz mentions "Space Cake Break at the Titicaca Lake."</p>
<p>Stand-up comedian Bill Bailey performs a riff in his Part Troll live show in which he asks members of the audience for suggestions for foods to place cannabis in. They include shepherd's pie, beef stroganoff and "just toast".</p>
<p>The segue "Die Eier von Satan" (which literally translates to the "eggs of Satan", but "eggs" bear the connotation of testicles in German, like "balls" in English) from the 1996 Tool album Ænima has as its lyrical component a recipe in German that includes the ingredient "a knife-tip of Turkish hashish".</p>
