<h1>Plum cake</h1>
<p>Plum cake has historically referred to an early type and style of fruitcake in England since around 1700.</p>
<p>In contemporary times, plum cake may also refer to a type of cake prepared using plum as a primary ingredient.</p>
<p>Prune cake is a type of plum cake.</p>
<h2>Europe </h2>
<p>In the 1881 book Sweet Dishes, Colonel Henry-Herbert says that "a good English plum cake...is a national institution".</p>
<p>The English version of plum cake also exists on the European mainland, although these may not contain as much fruit and may be drier compared to English versions.</p>
<h2>United States </h2>
<p>Plum cake in the United States originated from English settlers around "the turn of the eighteenth century", and was prepared in the English style.</p>
<p>During colonial times in the U.S., a virtually identical cake was called election cake, and was prepared with currants, raisins, molasses and spices, with the addition of brandy in the recipe occurring later.</p>
<p>Plum cake recipes in the fruitcake style appeared in early cookbooks in the Southern United States, and did not actually call for plums.</p>
<p>After 1830 in the U.S., plum cake was often referred to as fruit cake or black cake.</p>
<p>In 1885, plum cake in the U.S. was described in the book Some noted princes, authors  statesmen of our time as a solid, dark-colored, thick cake with copious amounts of plums, gritty notes from raisins, and as "mucilaginous".</p>
<h2>In popular culture </h2>
<p>At times, Thomas Carlyle ate a light style of plum cake while drinking tea, which he would dip into the tea.</p>
