<h1>Hot milk cake</h1>
<p>Hot milk cake is a traditional two layer cake, possibly from the Mid-Atlantic States. It can be frosted with mocha icing.</p>
<p>It is served every year at the Anne Arundel County Historical Society annual Strawberry Festival at Baltimore-Washington International Airport.</p>
<p>It is also a traditional quick one layer cake served in the Southern U.S., topped with fruit, powdered sugar icing, or boiled coconut topping.</p>
<p>Hot milk cake gets its distinctive flavor from the scalded milk that is the liquid component of the batter. It differs from traditional sponge cakes in that it does contain baking powder as leavening, and the eggs are beaten together whole instead of whipping the yolks and whites separately.</p>
