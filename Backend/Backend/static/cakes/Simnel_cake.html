<h1>Simnel cake</h1>
<p>Simnel cake is a light fruit cake with two layers of almond paste or marzipan, one in the middle and one on top,</p>
<p>Conventionally eleven, or occasionally twelve, marzipan balls are used to decorate the cake, with a story that the balls represent the twelve apostles, minus Judas </p>
<h2>Ingredients </h2>
<p>The cake is made from these ingredients: white flour, sugar, butter, eggs, fragrant spices, dried fruits, zest and candied peel.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>Simnel cakes have been known since at least medieval times. Recently, they became a Mothering Sunday tradition, when young girls in service would make one to be taken home to their mothers on their day off. The word simnel probably derived from the Latin word simila, meaning fine, wheaten flour.</p>
<p>A popular legend attributes the invention of the Simnel cake to Lambert Simnel; however, references to the cake were recorded some 200 years before his birth.</p>
<p>Different towns had their own recipes and shapes of the Simnel cake. Bury, Devizes and Shrewsbury produced large numbers to their own recipes, but it is the Shrewsbury version that became most popular and well known.</p>
