<h1>Gingerbread man</h1>
<p>A gingerbread man is a biscuit or cookie made of gingerbread, usually in the shape of a stylized human, although other shapes, especially seasonal themes (Christmas, Halloween, Easter, etc.) and characters, are quite common.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>Gingerbread dates back to the 15th century, and figural biscuit-making was practiced in the 16th century.</p>
<h2>Characteristics </h2>
<p>Most gingerbread men share the same roughly humanoid shape, with stubby feet and no fingers. Many gingerbread men have a face, though whether the features are indentations within the face itself or other candies stuck on with icing or chocolate varies from recipe to recipe. Other decorations are common; hair, shirt cuffs, and shoes are sometimes applied, but by far the most popular decoration is shirt buttons, which are traditionally represented by gum drops, icing, or raisins.</p>
<h2>In world records </h2>
<p>According to the Guinness Book of Records, the worldâ€™s largest gingerbread man was made by the staff of the IKEA Furuset store in Oslo, Norway, on November 9, 2009. The gingerbread man weighed 1,435 pounds, 3 ounces (651kg).</p>
