<h1>Parkin (cake)</h1>
<p>Parkin or Perkin is a gingerbread cake traditionally made with oatmeal and treacle, 5 November, but is also enjoyed throughout the winter months. It is baked commercially throughout Yorkshire, but is mainly a domestic product in other areas.</p>
<h2>Etymology </h2>
<p>The origin of the word parkin is unknown. The first published dated reference to parkin was collected from 1728 from the West Yorkshire Quarter Sessions when Anne Whittaker was accused of stealing oatmeal to make parkin. The Lancashire weaver Tim Bobbin describes tharf cake in 1740- and this is recognisable as a parkin. A possible older use of parkin is in the seventeenth century ballad 'The song of Arthur O'Bradley' that purports to describe a merry wedding from the time of Robin Hood (fourteenth century)</p>
<p>The tharf cake is of ancient Teutonic origin. Tharf or theorf meaning unleavened, un-fermented, solid tough or sodden. John Wycliffe in his translation of the Bible in 1389 (Mark Ch.14.v. 1) calls unleavened bread a 'tharf loove'</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>Parkin is virtually unknown south of the Humber. It is eaten in an area where oats rather than wheat was the staple grain for the poor. It is closely related to tharf cakes- an unsweeted cake cooked on a griddle rather than baked.</p>
<p>In Northern Europe honey was used as a medicine, for festive cakes and making mead; before 1750 sweetness was not a characteristic of everyday food. Honey cakes had a special festive significance. They were baked to be hard, but after storage for a couple of weeks they regained their moisture becoming soft and even sticky. Molasses has the hygroscopic property. German Lebkuchen and Pfefferkuchen were other examples of hygroscopic holiday ginger-breads. They too were baked hard in summer and allowed to moisten for consumption at Christmas.</p>
<p>Though parkin and tharf cake appear to be synonymous- generally all parkins were sweet tharf cakes.</p>
<p>Parkin and tharf cake were used interchangeably in Lancashire and South Yorkshire until 1900. Over the 500 years the recipe and taste of these cakes have changed considerably. It was the food of the poor. Ovens were rare in the houses of the poor, and they generally had no access to public bakers before the 1820s, so cooked cakes on griddles or bakestones on an open fire. The best parkin was made with fresh oatmeal, which fixes the date around the first week in November.</p>
<p>In southern Lancashire, and West Yorkshire parkin is inextricably linked to the Guy Fawkes Night celebration. Jennifer Stead, in her study Prodigal Frugality , identifies the link between Guy Fawkes and parkin as the bonfire .</p>

<h2>Ingredients </h2>
<p>The principal ingredients of a Yorkshire parkin are oatmeal, flour, black treacle (similar to molasses), fat (traditionally lard, but modern recipes use butter or margarine), and ginger. Oatmeal and treacle are generally considered distinctive features of Yorkshire parkin. Lancashire Parkin is baked using Golden Syrup and extra sugar.</p>
<p>The flour used in parkin in England is self-raising, containing a small amount of chemical leavening agent. If this is not available, or if the proportion of oatmeal is high, it is essential to add a leavening agent, e.g. baking powder or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar.</p>
<p>One of the key features of parkin is that it retains its texture well. It is baked to be hard, but after storing in a sealed tin or box for several days, it becomes soft again, the texture that is intended.</p>
