<h1>Karpatka</h1>
<p>Karpatka is a traditional Polish cream pie filled with budyń (Polish pudding) based vanilla cream. It is made of two layers choux pastry with one layer of cream in between. It takes its name from the mountain-like shape of the pastry (after the Carpathian Mountains – Karpaty in Polish). The cake is dusted with icing sugar.</p>
<p>Karpatka is a very popular dessert in Poland, usually served at Easter, for birthdays, name days or without any special occasion.</p>
<p>There are Karpatka baking mixes available in many shops in Poland.</p>
