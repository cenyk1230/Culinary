<h1>Upside-down cake</h1>
<p>An upside-down cake is a cake that is baked in a single pan, then turned over and served upside-down.[citation needed]</p>
<p>Usually chopped fruits—such as apples, pineapples, or cherries—and a butter and sugar topping are placed on the bottom of the pan before the batter is poured in, so that they form a decorative topping once the cake is inverted.</p>
<p>Traditional upside-down preparations include the American pineapple upside-down cake, French Tarte Tatin, Rocky Road upside-down cake, and Brazilian Bolo de banana. It is also well known in Hawaiian culture.[citation needed]</p>
