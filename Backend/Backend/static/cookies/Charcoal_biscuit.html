<h1>Charcoal biscuit</h1>
<p>A charcoal biscuit is a biscuit based on a powdered willow charcoal or activated carbon</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>It was first made in England in the early 19th century, as an antidote to flatulence and stomach trouble.</p>
<h2>Contemporary forms </h2>
<p>In modern times charcoal biscuits are made in the form of crackers to accompany cheeses. The biscuits have a slight hint of charcoal taste that is described by some as pleasing.</p>
<h2>Cultural references </h2>
<p>In Brideshead Revisited, Evelyn Waugh writes of Charles Ryder consuming charcoal biscuits and iced coffee while cramming for exams at Oxford. Ludwig Wittgenstein is said to have eaten very little else while staying in Ireland.</p>
<p>In August 2012, charcoal biscuits were featured in the dessert round of an episode of the Chopped: Grillmasters tournament on Food Network.</p>
