<h1>Tea loaf</h1>
<p>A tea loaf is an English cake, made with fruit and cinnamon (or other spices), and traditionally served sliced and spread with butter. Tea loaf is now somewhat old-fashioned but is still available, and is particularly associated with Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Often in the making of tea loaves, the fruit (usually currants and sultanas) is soaked in cold tea to plump it before mixing it into the batter.</p>
