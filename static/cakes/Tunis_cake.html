<h1>Tunis cake</h1>
<p>A Tunis cake is a Madeira cake topped with a thick layer of chocolate and decorated with marzipan fruits. It is traditionally eaten at Christmas.</p>
<p>The origins of the cake are Edwardian. Scottish bakery Macfarlane Langs produced commercial Tunis Cakes in the 1930s, and when they merged with McVitie  Price in 1948 to form a company called United Biscuits (which still owns the McVitieâ€™s brand) the recipe passed to the new company. McVitie's produced a Tunis cake until the mid 1980s.</p>
