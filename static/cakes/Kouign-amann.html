<h1>Kouign-amann</h1>
<p>Kouign-amann (pronounced [,kwiɲˈamɑ̃nː] Breton pl. kouignoù-amann) is a Breton cake. It is a round crusty cake, made with bread dough containing layers of butter and sugar folded in, similar in fashion to puff pastry albeit with fewer layers. The resulting cake is slowly baked until the butter puffs up the dough (resulting in the layered aspect of it) and the sugar caramelizes. The name derives from the Breton words for cake ("kouign") and butter ("amann"). Kouign-amann is a speciality of the town Douarnenez in Finistère, Brittany, where it originated in around 1860. The strict recipe of Douarnenez requires a ratio of 40 percent dough, 30 percent butter and 30 percent sugar.</p>
<p>The Welsh equivalent is the etymologically identical Cacan menin, literally 'cake, butter'.</p>
<h2>Popularity </h2>
