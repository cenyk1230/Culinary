<h1>Fat rascal</h1>
<p>A fat rascal, closely related to the historical turf cake, is a type of cake, similar to a scone or rock cake in both taste and ingredients. It originated in Yorkshire at least as early as the 1800s.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>Fat rascals were known in the Yorkshire region in the nineteenth century as a form of tea cake containing butter and cream.</p>
<h2>Bettys </h2>
<p>A widely recognised version of the Fat Rascal was introduced by Bettys Café Tea Rooms in North Yorkshire in 1983. This is a plump, fruity scone with a 'face' made from cherries and almonds based on a rock cake recipe, developed by Helen Frankel, then a buyer and marketing assistant at Bettys. Following its launch, the Fat Rascal quickly became Bettys’ best known and best-selling bakery product, selling over 375,000 per year.[citation needed] Bettys  Taylors of Harrogate own the registered trade mark for the name 'fat rascal'.</p>
