<h1>Snow skin mooncake</h1>
<p>Snow skin mooncake, Snowy mooncake, Ice skin mooncake or Crystal mooncake is a Chinese food eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Snow skin mooncakes are a non-baked mooncake which originated in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The snow skin mooncake is similar to mochi ice cream or yukimi daifuku, as both have glutinous rice crusts and have to be kept frozen. The requirements of production, storage and transportation for snow skin mooncakes are more stringent than for baked mooncakes.</p>
<p>Although snow skin mooncakes are usually made and sold by bakeries, these mooncakes are not baked in ovens like traditional cakes. Unlike traditional mooncakes which are served at room temperature, snow skin mooncakes are typically eaten cold.</p>
<h2>Crusts </h2>
<p>The crust of snow skin mooncake is made of glutinous rice which is frozen. The typical color of snow skin mooncakes is white and they are served cold, which is how it gets the name "snow skin". However, mooncakes may have other colors because of added flavors in their crusts. For example, if chocolate is added, the color of the crust might be brown.</p>
<h2>Fillings </h2>
<p>Traditional mooncakes are usually filled with salted duck egg yolks and lotus seed paste or red bean paste, while snow skin mooncake can be filled with varied things such as mung bean paste, fruit, jam, chocolate, coffee, cheese and other flavor fillings.</p>
<p>Some other examples include:</p>
<h2>Storage </h2>
<p>Snow skin mooncakes are usually packaged in plastic bags in pairs or individually. Because they are not baked, snow skin mooncakes must be refrigerated and can be stored in freezer up to a few weeks. They are typically thawed a few hours in a refrigerator before serving, to allow them to soften. They should be consumed within 2 hours. Refreezing is not advised.</p>
