<h1>Chocolate-coated marshmallow treats</h1>
<p>Chocolate-coated marshmallow treats are produced in different variations around the world, with several countries claiming to have invented it or hailing it as their "national confection". The first chocolate-coated marshmallow treat was created in the early 1800s in Denmark.</p>
<h2>National varieties </h2>
<p>In New Zealand, a common chocolated-coated marshmallow treat is the chocolate fish. A fish-shaped delicacy, 12 to 20 centimeters (5 to 8 inches) in length, it is made of pink or white marshmallow covered in a thin layer of milk chocolate. The milk chocolate's texture features ripples or (scales) on the fish, created by the fish moving under a blower during production.</p>
<p>In Kiwi culture the chocolate fish is a common reward for a small job done well ("Give that kid a chocolate fish").</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom this confection is known as a chocolate teacake,</p>
<p>The product itself consists of a small round shortbread base covered with a hemisphere of Italian meringue, a whipped egg white concoction similar to marshmallow. This is then coated in a thin layer of milk or plain chocolate and, in the case of Tunnock's, wrapped in a distinctive red and silver foil for the more popular milk chocolate variety, and a blue and gold wrapping for the plain chocolate type. Several competing brands to Tunnock's, such as Lees' Foods, also include jam in the centre of the teacake. In 2013 British café chain Costa Coffee introduced the giant marshmallow teacake, which is around 3 times the size of a standard teacake, with a chocolate biscuit base topped with marshmallow and raspberry jam in the centre.</p>
<p>An argument about whether the teacake is a biscuit or a cake led to an action in the European Court of Justice by British company Marks and Spencer. The UK tax authorities had eventually accepted the company's argument that the teacakes were cakes (biscuits are taxed, cakes are not), but refused to repay most of the VAT. The European court ruled that that in principle the tax should be repaid</p>
<p>In Turkey, there is no any single term in common use. Literally, it can be called "Konfeksiyon". Sometimes it could be called by related brand names as in "Çokomel" or "Eti Puf"</p>
<p>In Denmark the confection is known as a flødebolle (cream bun) and was formerly known as a negerbolle (negro bun) or negerkys (negro kiss). In the 1960s through 1980s the term negro was phased out by all major producers, as it is considered racist. Denmark also markets a variation shaped more like a patty, hence the name bøf (steak).</p>
<p>Denmark is arguably the largest producer of chocolate-coated marshmallow treats, producing approximately 800 million of these every year. The largest producer, Elvirasminde, produces roughly 650 million treats, sending 400 million abroad and leaving the remaining 250 million to be eaten by the Danish population, putting the amount of flødeboller eaten at 45 per Dane per year.</p>
<p>In Denmark chocolate-coated marshmallow treats are traditionally handed out in school by children on their birthday. They are found in any supermarket, and most confectioners will have delicacy versions. Sometimes they are even found in restaurants. Many baking enthusiast see them as a challenge, and it was a technical challenge in Den store Bagedyst (The Great Bake Off) on Danish TV.</p>
<p>The popularity of the treat is evident from the sheer number of varieties. Variation in coating ranging from white chocolate over dark chocolate to licorice coating, with or without sprinkles. The base is often a plain cracker in commercial products, but delicacy and homemade versions often have shortbread, marzipan biscuits or other bases. Flavored filling is also very common especially when homemade, but licorice, marzipan and other flavors are commercially available. Variation in form is also common, often this is seen in commercial products ranging from wide and flat (bøf) to tall with sharp edges (Christmas tree).</p>
<p>Krembo, Creambo (Hebrew: קרמבו‎, a contraction meaning literally "Cream-in-it") is the name of a chocolate-coated marshmallow treat that is popular in Israel, especially in the winter as an alternative to ice-cream.</p>
<p>European chocolate-coated marshmallow treats were popular as homemade sweets in Mandate Palestine, when it was known as Kushi (Hebrew כושי, "negro") and Rosh Kushi (Hebrew language: ראש כושי "negro's head") This name was borrowed from the names then used in Europe. It entered mass production in 1966. The first manufacturer, the Whitman Company, coined the name Krembo. In Hebrew, the word krembo is a combination of krem (cream) and bo (in it). A mocha flavour was introduced in 1967. In 1979 Whitman was acquired by Strauss which has the major part of the krembo market in Israel.  In 2007, Nestlé introduced an ice cream variation of krembo called Lekbo (Hebrew: לקבו, "lick inside").</p>
<p>Krembos are a seasonal treat sold only four months a year, from October to February.</p>
<p>In 2005, Strauss signed an agreement with Unilever to export ice cream and krembos to the United States and Canada due to a demand for products of this type with strict Kosher certification. Under terms of the agreement, they may be sold only in kosher supermarkets and import shops. The distributor in North_America is Dairy Delight, a subsidiary of Norman's Dairy. In 2007, Nestlé introduced an ice cream variation of krembo called Lekbo (Hebrew: לקבו, "lick inside").</p>
<p>The average krembo weighs 25grams (0.882 ounces) and has 115 calories.</p>
<p>Under kashrut, the dietary rules of Jewish law or (Halacha), some orthodox rabbis find significance to the order in which one eats a Krembo. The blessing over the biscuit is boreh miney mezonot, whereas the blessing over the cream and chocolate is shehakol nihiyya bidvaro. According to halacha, when eating a dish of mixed components, one need pronounce only the blessing over the main components, thus for a chocolate croissant one would say the blessing over the dough, and skip the blessing over the chocolate. But in the case of the Krembo, there is no consensus as to which is the "main" component: the biscuit, or the cream and chocolate. One solution is to bless over each component separately.</p>
<p>The Krembo has become a pop-cultural/national icon. Although considered a children's treat, sociologists have found that it is consumed as a Comfort_food by Israeli expatriates in the United States, evoking Nostalgia for their childhood.</p>
<p>Israeli rock band Kaveret's hit song "Shir HaMakolet" ("The Grocery Store Song") mentions a character buying Krembo.</p>
<p>In the Hebrew version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, as translated by Gili Bar-Hillel, Dumbledore's favourite sweet is a Krembo, rather than a sherbet lemon.</p>
<p>Alon 'Krembo' Sagiv is a fictional character in the Israeli cult film Mivtza_Savta(Operation Granny), as a child on a kibbutz he once stole an entire case of Krembos and locked himself in his room. With the entire kibbutz waiting for him outside he had to dispose of the evidence and ate the entire case(500 krembos!), earning himself his much-loathed nickname.</p>
<p>In the United States, Mallomars are produced by Nabisco.</p>
<p>Mallomars are generally available from early October through to April. They are not distributed during the summer months, supposedly because they melt easily in summer temperatures, though this is as much for marketing reasons as for practical ones.</p>
<p>Schokoküsse were first introduced in industrial numbers in 1920, although the first mention of them in Germany dates back to 1829. The sweets are sold all year long. This makes an average of about one dozen per person per year. They are available in supermarkets, many bakeries and some schools. Sometimes they are consumed pressed between two halves of a bun, which is also referred to as a Matschbrötchen ("Mud Roll", "Squished Bread Roll")—mostly by children.</p>
<p>These sweets are made of sweetened egg white foam and not marshmallows. In most cases the used sweetener is sugar, but there are also sugar-free products with sugar substitutes on the German market. The consistency is quite fluffy and not sticky or gooey.</p>
<p>They were first only known under the names Mohrenkopf ("Moor's Head") or Negerkuss ("Negro's Kiss"), but most companies changed the official product-name to the more neutral Schokoküsse or Schokokuss ("Chocolate Kiss"), Schaumküsse or Schaumkuss ("Foam Kiss") or to brand-specific names.</p>
<p>In German-speaking Switzerland they are still sold as Mohrenkopf.</p>
<p>In Finland, the name originated from Germany, and they were named "Negro Kisses" in 1951. In 2001 the name was changed to "Brunberg's Kisses", after the manufacturer, for largely the same reasons as in Denmark, Germany, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>In Flanders, the confection is known as Negerinnetetten. The word can either be translated as "negress's tits"  or could originate from the French word for head: "tête", as the French word for this confection used to be tête de nègre, which is French for "negro's head". This is also the probable origin of an alternative name Negertetten. Nowadays manufacturers market the confection under a different name, as the aforementioned terms are considered to be offensive.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands the name is Negerzoenen ("Negro kisses") though some companies have changed the name to Zoenen ("Kisses"). This led to some controversy, since the Dutch word neger is generally perceived as more neutral compared to the English equivalent negro, which is sometimes considered pejorative and racist.</p>
<p>Whippet cookies are produced in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. They consist of a biscuit base topped with marshmallow-like filling and then coated in a hard shell of pure chocolate. Whippet cookies first came to the market in 1927, although they had been produced and distributed by Viau under the name "Empire" as early as 1901. Today, the cookies are still produced in Montreal at the east end of the Viau factory, which is now owned by Dare Foods. They are currently available with both dark chocolate and milk chocolate coatings, and with several flavors of artificial fruit jam filling inside the marshmallow-like filling.</p>
<p>The cookies are similar to Mallomars of New York City. They also bear a striking resemblance to Tunnock's Tea Cakes as well as Krembos. However, the Tunnock tea cake does not have the same kind of chocolate and a different type of filling.</p>
<p>The Whippet cookie is a distinct part of Quebec culture because it does not travel well outside its area of production. This is partly because the pure chocolate melts very easily (compared with a chocolate mixture) and therefore they require refrigerated transport in summer. Furthermore, the combination of the hard chocolate shell and the air-filled inner marshmallow make them self-destruct when placed in the unpressurised or semi-pressurised cargo section of an airplane. However, they are currently available at various grocery locations throughout Canada and the US.</p>
<p>Though usually known by their proper trade name 'Whippets', these biscuits are also popularly referred to in the Montreal area as 'Nun's Farts' in the Anglophone community. Though they bear absolutely no resemblance to the Quebec pastry confections called pets de soeurs, it has been suggested that the combination of dark chocolate coating and white marshmallow filling is evocative of the black and white habits of certain orders of Quebec nuns. This, in conjunction with their light and airy texture, may have given rise to the cheeky Anglo-Quebecois moniker. It is not used by the francophone community.</p>
<p>An episode of the Canadian science program How It's Made showed the production process behind the cookie. However, many aspects of the production process (the amount of marshmallow filling, the ingredients, etc.) were not revealed. The show's narrator described these aspects as "classified information." As Canadian law requires an ingredient list on each package, the amount of confidential information involved is limited.</p>
<p>Another Canadian cookie, "Viva Puffs", is produced by Dare Foods in five flavours. Viva is a trade name; these confections have been known in (English) Canada for at least 50 years as "chocolate puffs".</p>
<p>In the Philippines, Fibisco makes a product similar to Mallomars called Choco Mallows that, unlike Mallomars, is available year-round. Likely due to the tropical climate, the "hard chocolate shell" of a Choco Mallow is usually just a soft chocolate covering that does not completely harden even after being refrigerated. Choco Mallows are usually covered in foil and sold in boxes of six, although street vendors and small corner stores may also sell them by piece.</p>
<p>In Bolivia, Chocolates Condor is the traditional manufacturer of "Beso de Negro" (Negro Kiss). The confection is similar to the German Schokoküsse in its use of a sweetened egg white foam filling rather than a marshmallow-based filling. There have been attempts to introduce variations in flavor, but the "classic" version remains the most popular.</p>
<p>In Peru and Ecuador, the confections are known as "Beso de Moza" (Girl's Kiss)(link), sold by Nestle. Currently there is a contest between strawberry and lucuma flavors to become permanent versions of the product.</p>
<p>In Colombia, it's called Beso de Negra (Black Woman's Kiss) or "Chocmelo", a portmanteau of chocolate and masmelo (marshmallow). However, these last ones don't always have a cookie as its base.</p>
<p>In Portugal, these confections are known as "Bombocas". Sold by different brands, usually the supermarket ones. They are sold in 3 main flavors: meringue (white interior), strawberry (pink) and vanilla (yellow). They are being called "Beijinhos" in the last few years.</p>
<p>In New Zealand biscuit manufacturers Griffin's make MallowPuffs, a chocolate biscuit that is described as a "light fluffy marshmallow sitting on top of a shortcake biscuit, covered in luxurious milk chocolate".]</p>
<p>Produced in Serbia by Jaffa, it has a cookie base and a soft sponge filling covered by a cocoa mix.</p>
<p>In Brazil the desert is known as Nhá Benta and is manufactured by the Kopenhagen chocolaterie.</p>
<p>Zefir (Russian: Зефи́р, may also be spelled zephyr or zephir) is made from fruit and berry purée with added sugar and whipped egg whites. It is commonly produced and sold in the countries of the former Soviet Union. The recipe is a merger of the traditional Russian pastila with French meringue. The name given after the Greek god of the light west wind Zephyr symbolizes its delicate airy consistency.</p>
<p>The consistency is similar to that of marshmallows, Schokokuss or krembo. The form typically resembles traditional meringue. However in contrast to commercial meringue, it is never crisp. Both pure and chocolate-coated versions are widespread. In contrast to the other confectioneries of this type, it has no biscuit base.</p>
<h2>Other varieties </h2>
<p>In Lebanon, a local variation went on sale in the 1950s under the name ras el abd (slave's head) by Gandour; A similar product in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia is Wagon Wheels. In Australia the closest product is Arnott's Chocolate Royals, which are available in milk and dark chocolate varieties, and are similar in appearance to a Tunnock's teacake. Choco Pie, produced by Orion Confectionery in Korea, are similar to the North American MoonPie and Scooter Pie. In South Africa, they are known as Sweetie Pies.</p>
