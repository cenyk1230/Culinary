<h1>Empire biscuit</h1>
<p>An Empire biscuit (Imperial biscuit, Double biscuit, German biscuit, Belgian biscuit Double Shortbread or Empire Cookie) is a sweet biscuit popular in the United Kingdom, particularly Scotland, and other Commonwealth countries. It is typically considered a traditional Scottish snack.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>The biscuit was originally known as the "Linzer Biscuit", and later the "Deutsch Biscuit". With the outbreak of World War I it was renamed to Empire biscuit, except in Northern Ireland where it remains known as the German Biscuit. In Northern Ireland it is commonly found with a jam and coconut topping. It is also known as the "Belgian biscuit", due to being topped in a similar way to a Belgian bun made of pastry or dough.</p>
<h2>Ingredients </h2>
<p>The typical Empire Biscuit has a layer of jam in between two biscuits, typically Shortbread. The top is covered with white water icing, usually decorated with a glace cherry in the centre, but Jelly Tots are common too. They are derived from the Austrian Linzer Torte. The biscuit is smaller than the Linzer Torte and does not have a cut-out section on the top.</p>
<h2>Similar products </h2>
<p>Empire biscuits are similar to Viennese Whirls.</p>
<h2>New Zealand </h2>
<p>Known as "Belgium" or "Belgian Biscuit" in the Southern part of the South Island of New Zealand. Typically found in most bakeries as either a biscuit as described, or in the form of a slice or cake. Shortbread biscuit or cake typically chocolate flavoured and brown in colour. Topped with white icing, and the distinct addition of raspberry jelly crystals scattered on top instead of the cherry. Large Scottish contingent of Early Settlers may have led to popularity in Dunedin and surrounds.</p>
