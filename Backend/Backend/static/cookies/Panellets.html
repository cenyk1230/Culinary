<h1>Panellets</h1>
<p>Panellets or the Land of Valencia, together with chestnuts and sweet potatoes. Panellets are often accompanied with a sweet wine, usually moscatell, mistela, vi de missa or vi ranci. Panellets are small cakes or cookies in different shapes, mostly round, made mainly of marzipan (a paste made of almonds and sugar). The most popular are the panellets covered with pine nuts, consisting of the panellet basis (i.e. marzipan) rolled in pine nuts and varnished with egg whites. In Sevilla (southern Spain) these cookies are known as empi√±onados.</p>
<p>Panellets date at least to the 18th century, when they were used as blessed food to share after some religious celebrations (Panellets de Sant Marc and Panellets de la Santa Creu)."</p>
<p>It is believed that its origins are in northern Europe,[citation needed] or more likely of Arab origin for the ingredients used.</p>
<p>Within Europe panellets have TSG status.</p>
