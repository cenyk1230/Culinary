<h1>Frog cake</h1>
<p>The frog cake is a dessert in the shape of a frog's head, composed of sponge cake and cream covered with fondant. It was created by the Balfours bakery in 1922, and soon became a popular treat in South Australia. Originally frog cakes were available exclusively in green, but later brown and pink were added to the range. Since then other variations have been developed, including seasonal varieties (such as snowmen and Easter "chicks"). The frog cake has been called "uniquely South Australian", and has been employed in promoting the state. In recognition of its cultural significance, in 2001 the frog cake was listed as a South Australian Heritage Icon by the National Trust of South Australia.</p>
<h2>Composition </h2>
<p>The frog cake is a small dessert shaped to resemble a frog with its mouth open,</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>Having traveled to France in the early 1920s, Gordon Balfour, the nephew of John Balfour, (who was one of the co-founders of Balfours Bakery), found inspiration for the frog cake in European confectionery. although they are now sold in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland as well.</p>
<p>The original frog cakes were green in colour, and green remains the most popular of the options, but chocolate and pink coloured versions were later added to the range.</p>
<p>Frog cakes have long been regarded as a South Australian icon, and have at times been used to help promote the state.</p>
<p>Historically, the frog cake has sold well for Balfours, and at times sales have peaked in response to events surrounding the company. When the company was placed into receivership in 2000, a column in The Advertiser by Rex Jory called for people to support the company by purchasing the cakes, and in response sales doubled to an "all-time high".</p>
