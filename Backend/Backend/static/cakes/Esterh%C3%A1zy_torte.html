<h1>Esterházy torte</h1>
<p>Esterházy torta is a Hungarian cake (torta) named after Prince Paul III Anton Esterházy de Galántha (1786–1866), a member of the Esterházy dynasty and diplomat of the Austrian Empire. It was invented by Budapest confectioners in the late 19th century and soon became one of the most famous cakes in the lands of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.[citation needed]</p>
<p>Esterházy torta consists of buttercream spiced with cognac or vanilla, sandwiched between four to five layers of almond meringue (macaroon) dough. The torte is iced with a fondant glaze and decorated with a characteristic chocolate striped pattern. There are, however, many different recipe variations. In Hungary, the original almonds have been entirely replaced by walnuts.</p>
<p>A popular variant, although not in Hungary, are Esterházy Schnitten: while a Torta is always of round shape, Schnitten are made in square shape. Other versions based on sponge cake or decorated with crystallized fruit also exist.</p>
