<h1>Russian tea cake</h1>
<p>Russian tea cake is a kind of pastry, often eaten around Christmas in the United States. It is a form of jumble, a pastry common in England during the Middle Ages. Similar varieties are known as Mexican wedding cakes (or cookies), Italian wedding cookies, butterballs, and occasionally snowball cookies for their powdery white spherical appearance when appearing around the winter holidays.</p>
<h2>Ingredients </h2>
<p>Russian tea cakes have a relatively simple recipe, generally consisting entirely of flour, water, butter, and ground nuts, the nut variety depending upon the cookie type. After baking, they are rolled in powdered sugar while still hot, then coated again once the cookie has cooled.</p>
<p>European-based recipes rely upon coarsely chopped hazelnuts, almonds, or walnuts.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>A reason for the common name "Russian Tea Cake" or any connection to Russian cuisine is unknown. By the 20th century, they were a part of wedding and Christmas traditions in the U.S., known by their popular "Russian tea cake" or "Mexican wedding cake" name.</p>
