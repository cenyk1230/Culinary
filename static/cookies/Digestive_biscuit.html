<h1>Digestive biscuit</h1>
<p>A digestive biscuit, sometimes described as a sweet-meal biscuit, is a semi-sweet biscuit (usually known in American English as a "cookie"</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>In 1839, digestives were first developed in the United Kingdom by two Scottish doctors to aid digestion.</p>
<p>In 1889, John Montgomerie of Scotland filed a U.S. patent application, which was granted in 1890. This patent asserted a prior patent existed in England dated 1886. The U.S. patent, titled "Making Malted Bread", included instructions for the manufacture of digestive biscuits. Montgomerie claimed this saccharification process would make "nourishing food for people of weak digestion ..."</p>
<p>Despite rumours that it is illegal for them to be sold under their usual name in the United States,</p>
<h2>Ingredients </h2>
<p>The typical digestive biscuit contains coarse brown wheat flour (which gives it its distinctive texture and flavour), sugar, malt extract, vegetable oil, wholemeal, raising agents (usually sodium bicarbonate, tartaric acid and malic acid) and salt. Dried whey, oatmeal, cultured skimmed milk and/or emulsifiers such as DATEM may also be added in some varieties.</p>
<p>A digestive biscuit averages around 70 calories, although this sometimes varies according to the factors involved in its production.</p>
<h2>Consumption </h2>
<p>Digestive biscuits are frequently eaten with tea or coffee. Sometimes, the biscuit is dunked into the tea and eaten quickly due to the biscuit's tendency to disintegrate when wet.</p>
<p>The digestive biscuit is also used as a cracker with cheeses, and is often included in "cracker selection" packets.</p>
<p>In the UK, McVitie's digestive is the best selling biscuit, with 80 million packs sold annually.</p>
<h2>Chocolate digestives </h2>
<p>Chocolate digestive biscuits also are available, coated on one side with milk, dark or white chocolate. Originally produced by McVitie's in 1925 in the UK as the Chocolate Homewheat Digestive, other recent varieties include the basic biscuit with chocolate shavings throughout (chocolate "chips" within the biscuit mix), or a layer of caramel, mint chocolate, orange-flavoured chocolate,</p>
<h2>Recipe substitution </h2>
<p>In recipes calling for digestive biscuits, it is common to substitute graham crackers in the United States. According to Charles Panati, the original graham cracker is called a "digestive biscuit" in the United Kingdom. However, graham crackers are typically a little dryer and more brittle.</p>
