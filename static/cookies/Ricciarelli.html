<h1>Ricciarelli</h1>
<p>Ricciarelli are traditional Italian biscuit - specifically, a type of macaroon - originating in 14th century Siena. Legend holds that they were introduced by Ricciardetto della Gherardesca in his castle near Volterra upon his return from the Crusades.[citation needed]</p>
<p>Today, the biscuits are made using an almond base that are set aside for two days before baking. The rough and crackled surface is usually lightly sprinkled with confectioner's sugar.</p>
<p>Ricciarelli are typically consumed at Christmas, served with a dessert wine such as Vin Santo or Moscadello di Montalcino.</p>
