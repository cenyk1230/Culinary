<h1>Petit four</h1>
<p>A petit four (plural: petits fours, also known as mignardises) is a small confectionery or savoury appetizer. The name is French, petit four (French pronunciation:​[pø.ti.fur]), meaning "small oven".</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>Petits fours were traditionally made in a smaller oven next to the main oven.]</p>
<p>In 19th century France, gas ovens did not exist. People largely used the breadmakers' ovens which only had two settings, a very strong and high heat setting used for roasting meats and vegetables, or the petit four setting. This setting was of a lower temperature allowing the correct heat to cook pastries.</p>
<h2>Types </h2>
<p>Petits fours come in three varieties:</p>
<p>In a French patisserie, assorted small desserts are usually called mignardises, while hard, buttery biscuits are called petit fours.</p>
