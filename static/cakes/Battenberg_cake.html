<h1>Battenberg cake</h1>
<p>Battenberg is a light sponge cake with the pieces covered in jam. The cake is covered in marzipan and, when cut in cross section, displays a distinctive two-by-two check pattern alternately coloured pink and yellow.</p>
<p>The cake is made by baking a yellow and a pink sponge cake separately, and then cutting and combining the pieces in a chequered pattern. The cake is held together by apricot jam and covered with marzipan.</p>
<h2>Origins </h2>
<p>The origin of the cake is unclear,</p>
<p>According to The Oxford Companion to Food, the name "Battenberg cake" first appeared in print in 1903.</p>
<h2>American variation </h2>
<p>In the United States there is a related confection called a checkerboard cake, so named because, as with a Battenberg cake, when it is sliced open it resembles the board for the game draughts, known in the U.S. as "checkers," which is played on a "checkerboard". A typical checkerboard cake is one that alternates between vanilla and chocolate flavoured sponge cake and has a very rich chocolate buttercream icing; unlike the British Battenberg it does not typically use marzipan and utilizes a special springform pan to get the desired effect.</p>
