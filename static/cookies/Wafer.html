<h1>Wafer</h1>
<p>In gastronomy, a wafer is a crisp, often sweet, very thin, flat, and dry biscuit,].</p>
<h2>Communion wafer </h2>
<p>The word also refers to the special small round, often starchy flatbreads made for Western Rite celebrations of the Eucharist, including Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran and some of the more liturgical Protestant churches. The word "host" is used to describe the larger wafer used by the clergy, while the term "communion wafer" refers to the smaller pieces used to distribute Holy Communion to the people. These holy wafers often have an image of a cross or the crucified Christ imprinted on them.</p>
<h2>Spa wafers </h2>
<p>Special "spa wafers" (Czech: lázeňské oplatky, Slovak: kúpeľné oblátky) are produced in the spa towns of the Czech Republic (e.g. Karlovy Vary, Mariánské Lázně, etc.) and the Slovak Republic (e.g. Piešťany, etc.).</p>

In some places, they might contain cheese, fruits, or chantilly cream, among others.</p>
