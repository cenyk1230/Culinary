<h1>Ruske kape</h1>
<p>Ruske kape (Trans. Russian Caps) are a type of cake dessert served in ex-Yugoslavia countries, especially in Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. It usually comes in a 6-inch-wide (150mm), round serving and includes coconut around the edge or sometimes crushed walnuts. The top is usually chocolate drizzled with vanilla. The center includes layers of alternating vanilla, chocolate, and sometimes a mocha flavor.</p>
<p>This dessert comes served chilled, usually on colorful plates drizzled with chocolate. It can be eaten with a fork but is sometimes eaten in a casual manner; people eat it like a cupcake with the hands.</p>
