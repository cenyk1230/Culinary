<h1>Whoopie pie</h1>
<p>The whoopie pie (alternatively called a black moon, gob [term indigenous to the Pittsburgh region], black-and-white, bob, or "BFO" for Big Fat Oreo [also recorded as "Devil Dogs" and "Twins" in 1835</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>While considered a New England phenomenon and a Pennsylvania Amish tradition,</p>
<p>The whoopie pie is the official state treat of Maine</p>
<p>The world's largest whoopie pie was created in South Portland, Maine, on March 26, 2011, weighing in at 1,062 pounds.</p>
<p>The town of Dover-Foxcroft, in Piscataquis County, Maine, has hosted the Maine Whoopie Pie Festival since 2009. In 2014, more than 7,500 people attended the festival.</p>
<h2>Origin controversy </h2>
<p>Pennsylvania, Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire all claim to be the birthplace of the Whoopie pie. In 2011, the Maine State Legislature considered naming the whoopie pie the official state pie. The proposal received bipartisan support. L.D. 71, officially known as "An Act to Designate the Whoopie Pie as the State Dessert", read "The whoopie pie, a baked good made of two chocolate cakes with a creamy frosting between them, is the official state dessert".</p>
<p>The now-defunct Berwick Cake Company of Roxbury, Massachusetts was selling "Whoopee Pies" as early as the 1920s, but officially branded the Whoopee Pie in 1928 to great success. It is also claimed that the whoopie pie originated in Massachusetts and spread both north and south.</p>
<p>The Maine Legislature eventually decided to declare the whoopie pie the official state treat, and chose blueberry pie (made with wild Maine blueberries) as the official state dessert.</p>
