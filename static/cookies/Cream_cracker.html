<h1>Cream cracker</h1>
<p>A cream cracker is a flat, usually square savoury biscuit. It is similar to a matzo, but it contains yeast and is typically thicker and approximately 8 cm square. The cream cracker was invented by Joseph Haughton at his home in Dublin, Ireland, and then manufactured by William Jacob in a small bakery around 1885. The name "cream crackers" refers to the method in which the mixture is creamed during manufacture.</p>
<p>They are made from wheat flour, palm oil and yeast, and are commonly served with cheese or other savoury topping such as Marmite or Vegemite. They are also eaten with butter or margarine or without accompaniment. An average cream cracker contains about 35 kcal.</p>
