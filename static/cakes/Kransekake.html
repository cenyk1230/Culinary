<h1>Kransekake</h1>
<p>The kransekage (literally wreath cake) is a traditional Danish (kransekage) and Norwegian (kransekake/kransekaka/tårnkake/-kaka (tower cake)) confection, usually eaten on special occasions such as weddings, baptisms, Christmas, or New Year's Eve.</p>
<h2>Cake </h2>
<p>Kransekage take the form of a series of concentric rings of cake, layered on top of each other in order to form a steep-sloped cone shape—often 18 or more layers—stuck together with white icing. The ideal kransekage is hard to the touch, yet soft and chewy.</p>
<p>The original variant used at weddings is called overflødighedshorn (horn of plenty) and is shaped like a cornucopia and filled with chocolates, cookies, and other small treats. Sometimes a bottle of wine or akvavit is placed in the center, and the cake is decorated with ornaments such as crackers and flags.</p>
<h2>Serving </h2>
<p>This confection is served by separating individual rings and breaking them into smaller pieces.</p>
<h2>Traditions </h2>
<p>One cultural tradition is for the bride and groom to lift the top layer of the cake at their wedding. The number of cake rings that stick to the top one when they lift it is said to be the number of children the couple will have.</p>
