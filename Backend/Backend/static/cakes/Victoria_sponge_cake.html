<h1>Sponge cake</h1>
<p>Sponge cake is a cake based on flour (usually wheat flour), sugar, and eggs, and is sometimes leavened with baking powder. It has a firm, yet well aerated structure, similar to a sea sponge. A sponge cake may be produced by the batter method or the foam method.</p>
<p>Cake made using the batter method is known as a butter or pound cake in the U.S., while in the U.K. it is known as Madeira cake or Victoria sponge cake. A cake made using the foam method is known as a sponge cake or, in the U.K., also as whisked sponge. These forms of cake are common in Europe, especially in French patisserie.</p>
<p>The sponge cake is thought to be one of the first of the non-yeasted cakes, and the earliest attested sponge cake recipe in English is found in the 1615 book of English poet and author Gervase Markham, The English Huswife, Containing the Inward and Outward Virtues Which Ought to Be in a Complete Woman. indicating that sponge cakes had been established in Grenada in the Caribbean, by the early 19th century.</p>
<p>Variations on the theme of a cake lifted, partially or wholly, by trapped air in the batter exist in most places where European patisserie has spread, including the Italian Génoise, the Portuguese pão-de-ló, the Anglo-Jewish "plava",</p>
<p>Derivatives of the basic sponge cake idea include the American chiffon cake and the Latin American Tres leches cake.</p>
<h2>Making a sponge cake </h2>
<p>Using the weight of 3 eggs, weigh the fat, sugar, and flour. A typical sponge cake is made by beating the eggs with sugar until they are light and creamy, The mixture is then poured into the chosen cake tin and baked. Both methods take great care to incorporate air in the beating, whisking, and sieving stages. This makes a very light product, but it is easy to lose the air by removing the cake before it has finished in the oven.</p>
<p>Before the mixture has cooled after cooking, it is still flexible. This allows the creation of rolled cakes such as the Swiss roll or the Bûche de Noël. This basic recipe is also used for many treats and puddings, such as madeleines, ladyfingers, and trifles, as well as some versions of strawberry shortcake. In addition, the sponge cake technique is used in angel food cake (where only egg whites are used) and some recipes for Belgian waffles (where the egg whites are separated from the yolk and folded into the batter at the end of preparation).</p>
<h2>Victoria sponge </h2>
<p>The Victoria sponge or Victoria sandwich cake was named after Queen Victoria, who was known to enjoy a slice of the sponge cake with her afternoon tea. It is often referred to simply as "sponge cake", though it contains additional fat. A typical Victoria sponge consists of raspberry jam and whipped double cream or vanilla cream. The jam and cream are sandwiched between two sponge cakes; the top of the cake is not iced or decorated apart from a dusting of icing sugar. The Women's Institute publishes a variation on the Victoria sandwich that has raspberry jam as the filling and is dusted with caster sugar, not icing sugar.</p>
<p>A Victoria sponge is made using one of two methods.</p>
<p>Sponge cakes can also be made suitable for vegan, lacto-ovo intolerant, and low cholesterol diets. Most often this is done by using plant based milk instead of dairy (such as rice or soya) and vegetable oil instead of eggs (although many alternatives to eggs are used such as flax seeds, bananas, and powdered egg replacers).</p>
<p>Other names for the Victoria Sponge are Victoria Sandwich and, less commonly, Victorian Cake.</p>
<p>Although simple to make, Victoria sponge recipes are notoriously sensitive to cooking times and temperatures. As such, oven manufacturers often use a Victoria sponge recipe to test their ovens.</p>
<h2>Sponge cakes during Passover </h2>
<p>Since sponge cakes are not leavened with yeast, they are popular dessert choices for the Passover feast. No raising agent may be used due to the strict prohibition of even the appearance of a leavening effect. Therefore, the beating of egg whites in the mix to achieve the aeration is an essential characteristic of any Passover Sponge recipe. So popular is the sponge cake at Passover that most families have at least one recipe they pass down through generations which is referred to as the Passover Sponge Cake, and matzo meal-based cake mixes are available commercially. Several brands are easily found in kosher stores specially before Passover. Typical Passover sponge flavorings include pecans, almonds, lemon, poppyseeds, apples, and dark chocolate. Either orange or apple juice are the liquid ingredient. Milk is avoided because it cannot be included in a dessert to be served after a meat based meal. The sponge, or a heavier variant in the form of an almond pudding, may be included as an element of the dessert in the Passover meal during the Seder service, when it is often combined in serving with a fruit compote.</p>
