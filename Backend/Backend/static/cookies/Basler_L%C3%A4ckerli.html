<h1>Basler Läckerli</h1>
<p>The Basler Läckerli (also Leckerli or Läggerli, lecker meaning "delicious" in German and -li being a diminutive suffix) is a traditional hard spice biscuit originating from Basel, Switzerland. It is made of honey, hazelnuts, almonds, candied peel, and Kirsch. The flat baked dough is, when still hot, cut into rectangular pieces. It is then topped with a sugar glaze.</p>
<p>Basler Läckerli were originally created by local spice merchants over 700 years ago and is available year-round.</p>
