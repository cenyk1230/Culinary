<h1>Angel cake</h1>
<p>Angel cake is a type of layer cake that originated in the United Kingdom. It consists of two or three layers of sweet sponge cake which is often coloured white, pink and yellow with a thin layer of white cream. It is traditionally sold in long bars or small slices.</p>
<p>The cake has won many awards, most notably the 'English Cake of the Year' in 1986. The largest recorded Angel cake was 1 metre in length and 50 centimetres in width, which was baked in the English town of Bakewell.</p>
