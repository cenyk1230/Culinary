<h1>Kichel</h1>
<p>Kichel (plural kichlach) is a popular Jewish and Israeli sweet cracker or cookie commonly made with egg and sugar rolled out flat and cut into large diamond shapes. Although sweet they are typically eaten with a savoury dip or topping. They are also popular in Israel as a sweet snack or dessert. Jews in South Africa commonly serve kichel with chopped herring. Due to their light, airy nature, the cookies have sometimes been called "nothings." When prepared with matzah meal rather than flour, kichlach can be consumed during the Passover holiday.</p>
