<h1>Nice biscuit</h1>
<p>A Nice biscuit is a coconut-flavoured biscuit. It is thin, rectangular in shape, with rounded bumps on the edges, and lightly covered with a scattering of large sugar crystals, often with the word "NICE" imprinted on top in sans-serif capital letters. It is often served as an accompaniment to hot drinks, such as tea. The name probably derives from the city of Nice in the south of France.</p>
<p>A Nice biscuit was listed in an Army and Navy Co-operative Society price list in 1895. Nice biscuits are sold by various companies under different brand names in most of the British Commonwealth as well as other countries.</p>
<p>Dutch biscuit maker Verkade claims its Nizza version (introduced in 1910) as the Netherlands' "most beloved cookie", and is celebrating the company's 125th anniversary with the release of a new cinnamon variant.</p>
