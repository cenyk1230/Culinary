<h1>Eccles cake</h1>
<p>An Eccles cake, sometimes also called Squashed Fly cake is a small, round cake filled with currants and made from flaky pastry with butter, sometimes topped with demerara sugar.</p>
<h2>Name and origin </h2>
<p>Eccles cakes are named after the English town of Eccles. It is not known who invented the recipe, but James Birch is credited with being the first person to sell Eccles cakes on a commercial basis, which he sold from his shop at the corner of Vicarage Road and St Mary's Road (now known as Church Street) in the town centre, in 1793.</p>
<p>Eccles cakes do not have Protected Geographical Status, so may be manufactured anywhere and still labelled as "Eccles" cakes.</p>
<h2>Similar pastries </h2>
<p>The Chorley cake (from Chorley in Lancashire) is flatter, made with shortcrust pastry rather than flaky pastry and is devoid of sugar topping.</p>
<p>The Blackburn cake is similarly named for the city of Blackburn, using stewed apples in place of currants.</p>
<p>The Banbury cake is an oval cake from Banbury.</p>
<h2>Fire hazard </h2>
<p>UK fire brigades have reported fires started by Eccles cakes overcooked in microwave ovens. The sugar contained in the cakes is alleged to be flammable.</p>
