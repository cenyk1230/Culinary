<h1>Berner Honiglebkuchen</h1>
<p>Berner Honiglebkuchen are Lebkuchen traditionally made in Berne, Switzerland. Distinguished from other Lebkuchen by their sometimes elaborate sugar decorations, they are not to be confused with the Berner Haselnusslebkuchen, another Bernese specialty which is made from ground hazelnuts.</p>
<h2>Composition and production </h2>
<p>Honiglebkuchen dough is made of honey, milk, margarine, flour and potassium carbonate (as leavening agent), as well as a mixture of spices.</p>
<p>After a leavening period of four days, the dough is softened by rolling it, rolled out to a thickness of 6 millimeters (0.24in), and cut into the desired shape. Most Honiglebkuchen are rectangular, but round or heart-shaped forms are also used.</p>
<p>The sugar decorations are traditionally applied manually by specialised confectioners using a triangular bag. The most popular motif is the bear, Berne's heraldic animal, which is shown in various scenes and poses, such as in the Bärengraben. Cheaper Lebkuchen, such as the one pictured above, feature standardised decorations applied by template.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>Lebkuchen with honey and exotic spices were already made in medieval Swiss monasteries.</p>
<p>Together with their hazelnut counterpart, Honiglebkuchen are the signature product of Bernese bakers and are particularly popular in the December holiday season, as well as with tourists throughout the year.</p>
<h2>Consumption </h2>
<p>Bakers recommend taking the Lebkuchen together with café au lait, in which the cake can also be dunked to improve its flavour.</p>
