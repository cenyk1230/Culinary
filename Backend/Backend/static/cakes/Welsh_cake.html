<h1>Welsh cake</h1>
<p>Welsh cakes (Welsh: picau ar y maen, pice bach, cacen gri or teisen radell), also Welshcakes or pics, are traditional in Wales.</p>
<p>The cakes are also known as bakestones within Wales because they are traditionally cooked on a bakestone (Welsh: maen), a cast iron griddle about 1.5cm or more thick which is placed on the fire or cooker; on rare occasions, people may refer to them as griddle scones.</p>
<p>Welsh cakes are made from flour, sultanas, raisins, and/or currants, and may also include such spices as cinnamon and nutmeg. They are roughly circular, a few inches (7–8cm) in diameter and about half an inch (1–1.5cm) thick.</p>
<p>Welsh cakes are served hot or cold dusted with caster sugar. Unlike scones, they are not usually eaten with an accompaniment, though they are sometimes sold ready split and spread with jam, and they are sometimes buttered.</p>
