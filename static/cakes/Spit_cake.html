<h1>Spit cake</h1>
<p>Spit cake is a generic term that denotes a variety of European cakes all made in a similar way: layers of dough or batter are deposited, one at a time, onto a tapered cylindrical rotating spit; the dough is baked by an open fire or a special oven, rotisserie-style. Generally, spit cakes are associated with celebrations such as weddings and Christmas. The spit can be dipped in a thin dough, or the dough can be poured or rolled on the spit. This cake group may have originated from Ancient Greek times, around 400 BC, when similar large cakes were prepared on spits for Dionysiac feasts.</p>
<h2>Preparation techniques </h2>
<p>The cooking process is similar for all the spit cakes: they all consist of a dough applied on a spit which is slowly rotated over an open fire or other heat source. One way of doing this is when the spit is dipped several times in a bowl with liquid dough or the thin dough is poured on spit. Depending on the dough's consistency and the spit's speed, it will form a layer on the spit, and when very runny, it will drop, thus producing small spikes, giving the cake a porcupine-like appearance. The resulting cake consists of many layers of cooked dough, and when cut is shown to consist of rings– hence another name, "tree cake".</p>
<p>Alternatively, the dough is wrapped around the spit as spiral threads. In some varieties of the cake, while they maintain the shape of the spit cake, the rings are actually baked separately and attached to each other with icing. Some spit cakes have a smooth surface. Others, like spettekaka and Šakotis, have an irregular shape.</p>
<h2>Varieties </h2>
<p>Variations on the basic process are found in many cultures; what they have in common is that the laborious and time-consuming process produces a cake suitable for special occasions, such as weddings or Christmas feasts. Some varieties are made with a dough with flowing paste while others use a more solid dough. In Austria, spit cakes are known as Prügelkrapfen; in Germany there are two varieties called Baumkuchen and Baumstriezel; in Hungary Kürtőskalács; in the Czech Republic and Slovakia Trdelník; in Sweden spettekaka;</p>
<p>Baumkuchen and Baumstriezel are German varieties of spit cake. Baumkuchen is prepared in the shape of a tree</p>
<p>Kürtőskalács is made of a dough made of wheat flour, egg, yeast, often extra egg yolks, milk, and butter, iced with sugar. The sugar will be caramelised, creating a hard, crisp brown layer on the cake's surface.</p>
<p>Its Slovak version is called trdelník or Skalický trdelník , and it was registered in December 2007 as PGI (protected geographical indication) in the European Union.</p>
<p>Šakotis or Raguolis is the Lithuanian traditional spit cake, It is a cake made with a loose dough of butter, eggs, flour, sugar, and cream, poured on the spit, forming "stalactites" when dropping from the spit. In Lithuanian means "peaked" or "branchy" or "branched tree" due to its conical shape resembling a pine tree, and with the drips looking like the tree branches. It is baked in a time- and labor-intensive process, by pouring layers of dough onto a rotating spit in a special open oven or over an open fire.</p>
<p>Spettekaka, the Swedish variety, is different in that the dough is made of potato flour. The ingredients are potato starch flour, sugar and eggs. The rest of the process is similar, the thin dough forming layers when it is slowly poured onto the skewer. The Spettekaka is a brittle and dry variety of this dessert, somewhat similar in consistency to meringue; it is light, airy and crisp. Spettekaka has a texture that readily breaks into little pieces under pressure, and they range in size anywhere from a few inches to several feet in height and over a foot in diameter. Small cakes are broken into pieces, while very large cakes are served by sawing them into pieces.</p>
<p>Kransekake is a somewhat similar Norwegian dish, and the Danish (kransekage) variety, Kransekage (or wreath cake), is formed of a series of concentric rings baked separately and made of ground almonds, egg whites and sugar, layered on top of each other and glued together with white icing to form a steep-sloped cone shape. Kransekake and spettekaka are traditionally served at weddings.</p>

<h2>Cornucopia </h2>
<p>A cornucopia or horn of plenty is a cake with a somewhat related shape, particularly associated with the Thanksgiving holiday in North America. The horn of plenty is a symbol of abundance and nourishment, commonly a large horn-shaped container overflowing with produce, flowers or nuts. Kransekake is sometimes baked in this form, especially for weddings. However, these pastries are baked in a traditional oven, not a rotating spit, and therefore cannot be called "spit cakes."</p>
