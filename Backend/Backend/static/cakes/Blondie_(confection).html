<h1>Blondie (confection)</h1>
<p>A blondie (also known as a "blond[e] brownie" or "blondie bar") is a rich, sweet dessert bar. It is made from flour, brown sugar, butter, eggs, baking powder, and vanilla, and may also contain walnuts or pecans. Chocolate chip blondies may contain white or dark chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, or other flavored chips.</p>
<p>Blondies resemble the traditional chocolate brownie, but substitute vanilla for the cocoa used in brownies, and also contain brown sugar. They are sometimes referred to as blonde brownies. They are baked in a pan in the oven similar to how traditional brownies are baked, then cut into rectangular shapes for serving.</p>
<p>Blondies are often confused with white chocolate brownies,[citation needed] although they differ significantly. Unlike the white chocolate brownie or the normal brownie, they contain no chocolate or chocolate flavouring, not inclusive of chocolate chips, which are often put in blondies.</p>
<p>Like brownies, blondies may include chocolate chips. They may also contain coconut, nuts, toffee, or any other chunky candy for added texture. Blondies aren't usually frosted; the brown sugar flavor tends to be sweet enough.</p>
<p>Another popular variation is the Congo bar, which contains chocolate chips with either walnuts or coconut.</p>
<p>Blondies are sometimes served in sundaes, often topped with caramel sauce.</p>
