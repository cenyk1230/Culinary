<h1>Florentine biscuit</h1>
<p>A Florentine biscuit (or, more correctly, a Florentine) is a pastry presumably of French origin and erroneously attributed to Italian cuisine.[citation needed] They are made of nuts (most typically hazel and almond) and candied cherries mixed with sugar molten together with butter and honey, cooked in oven. They are often coated on the bottom with chocolate. Other types of candied fruit are used as well. It typically contains neither flour nor eggs.</p>
