<h1>Date and walnut loaf</h1>
<p>Date and walnut loaf is a traditional cake eaten in Britain, made using dates and walnuts. It is often made with treacle or tea to give it a dark brown colour. Traditionally from Scotland, date and walnut loaf is still enjoyed in many tea rooms around the country. It is also enjoyed in cafes, bakeries and tea rooms in New Zealand, a former dominion of Great Britain.</p>
