<h1>Torta Tre Monti</h1>
<p>Torta Tre Monti (from Italian: three Mountain cake) is a traditional Sammarinese cake made of layers of thin waffled wafers cemented together by chocolate or hazelnut creme. The final product is covered in chocolate fondant. It is similar to other layered desserts common to San Marino, this one being representative of the Three Towers of San Marino.</p>
<p>In San Marino, the torta has been commercially produced by La Serenissima since 1942. The bakery markets both a full-size cake and snack-size version, in addition to a variation that includes coffee.</p>
