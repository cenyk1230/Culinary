<h1>Malted milk (biscuit)</h1>
<p>The malted milk is a type of biscuit, first produced by Elkes Biscuits of Uttoxeter (now owned by Fox's Biscuits) in 1924. They are named after their malt flavouring and milk content.</p>
<p>There are three main variations of the design which now varies from company to company. These are:</p>
<p>Variations include a chocolate covered single biscuit, as well as a custard cream like variety where two biscuits sandwich a vanilla-based cream.</p>
