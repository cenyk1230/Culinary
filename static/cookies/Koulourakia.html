<h1>Koulourakia</h1>
<p>Koulourakia (Greek: κουλουράκια, IPA:[kuluˈraca]; singular: κουλουράκι) are a traditional Greek dessert, typically made at Easter to be eaten after Holy Saturday.</p>
<p>They are a butter-based pastry, traditionally hand-shaped, with egg glaze on top. They have a sweet delicate flavor with a hint of vanilla. Koulourakia are well known for their sprinkle of sesame seeds and distinctive ring shape. In fact, the word is the diminutive form for a ring-shaped loaf or lifebelt. These pastries were also often shaped like small snakes by the Minoans, as they worshiped the snake for its healing powers.</p>
<p>Now the pastries can be shaped into braided circles, hairpin twists, figure eights, twisted wreaths, horseshoes or Greek letters, although they are still often shaped into a snake style. They are commonly eaten with morning coffee or afternoon tea. Like all pastries, they are normally kept in dry conditions in a jar with a lockable lid.</p>
<p>Often, a clove is added atop the center of the pastry for added flavor.</p>
