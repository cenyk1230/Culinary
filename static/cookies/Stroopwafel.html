<h1>Stroopwafel</h1>
<p>A stroopwafel (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈstroːpʋaːfəl]( listen)) (English translation: syrup waffle, treacle waffle, or caramel waffle; lit "syrup waffle") is a waffle made from two thin layers of baked dough with a caramel-like syrup filling in the middle. It is popular in the Netherlands. They were first made in the Dutch city of Gouda.</p>
<h2>Ingredients and baking </h2>
<p>The stiff dough for the waffles is made from flour, butter, brown sugar, yeast, milk, and eggs. Medium-sized balls of dough are put into a heated waffle iron and pressed into the required uniformly thin, round shape. After the waffle has been baked, and while it's still warm, it is split into thin layered halves. The warm filling, made from syrup, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon, is spread between the waffle halves, gluing them together.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>The stroopwafel originates from Gouda in the Netherlands. It was first made during the late 18th century</p>
