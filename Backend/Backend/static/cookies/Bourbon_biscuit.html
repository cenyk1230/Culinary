<h1>Bourbon biscuit</h1>
<p>The Bourbon biscuit (sometimes referred to as a Bourbon cream) is a sandwich style biscuit consisting of two thin oblong dark chocolateâ€“flavoured biscuits with a chocolate buttercream filling.</p>
<p>The biscuit was introduced in 1910 (originally under the name "Creola") by the biscuit company Peek Freans, of Bermondsey, London, originator of the Garibaldi biscuit.</p>
<p>Many other companies make their own version of the biscuit under the "Bourbon" name, including major supermarkets.</p>
