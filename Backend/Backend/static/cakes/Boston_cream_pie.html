<h1>Boston cream pie</h1>
<p>A Boston cream pie is a cake that is filled with a custard or cream filling and frosted with chocolate.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>Owners of the Parker House Hotel in Boston state that the Boston cream pie was first created at the hotel by Armenian-French chef M. Sanzian in 1856.</p>
<p>The commonly known variety is likely derived from the Washington pie, a two-layer yellow cake filled with jam and topped with confectioner's sugar, for which pastry cream of custard eventually replaced the jam, and a chocolate glaze replaced the confectioner's sugar. Today, the cake is topped with a chocolate glaze (such as ganache) and sometimes powdered sugar or a cherry.</p>
<p>The first known attested printed use of the term "Boston cream pie" occurred in the Granite Iron Ware Cook Book, printed in 1878.</p>
<p>The Boston cream pie is the official dessert of Massachusetts, declared as such on 12 December 1996.</p>
<h2>Other form </h2>
<p>A Boston cream doughnut is a name for a Berliner filled with vanilla custard or crème pâtissière and topped with icing made from chocolate.</p>
