<h1>Oreo</h1>
<p>Oreo is a sandwich cookie consisting of two chocolate wafers with a sweet creme filling in between, and (as of 1974) are marketed as "Chocolate Sandwich Cookies" on the package they are held in. The version currently sold in the United States is made by the Nabisco division of MondelÄ“z International. Oreo has become the best-selling cookie in the United States since its introduction in 1912.</p>
<h2>Etymology </h2>
<p>The origin of the name Oreo is unknown, but there are many theories, including derivations from the French word 'Or', meaning gold (as early packaging was gold), or the Greek word 'Oreo', meaning beautiful, nice or well done.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>The "Oreo Biscuit" was first developed and produced by the National Biscuit Company (today known as Nabisco) in 1912</p>
<p>The original design of the cookie featured a wreath around the edge of the cookie and the name "OREO" in the center.</p>
<p>The Oreo Biscuit was renamed in 1921, to "Oreo Sandwich." to include the Nabisco logo.</p>
<p>The modern Oreo cookie filling was developed by Nabisco's principal food scientist, Sam Porcello.</p>
<p>Starting in January 2006, Oreo cookies replaced the trans fat in the cookie with non-hydrogenated vegetable oil.</p>
<p>Nabisco began a marketing program in 2008, advertising the use of Oreo cookies in a game called DSRL, which stands for "Double Stuf Racing League." The DSRL was introduced one week prior to Super Bowl XLII. This sport had also been endorsed by football brothers Peyton Manning and Eli Manning. Another campaign started for Golden Double Stuf Oreo cookies with the brothers being challenged by Donald Trump  "Double Trump" played by Darrell Hammond; the date for this competition was January 24, 2010. The Mannings won in both cases. A new ad campaign is currently revolving around a 'Hooded Menace' threatening to take over the Double Stuf Racing League, and Eli Manning and Stufy (the DSRL mascot) needing some help airing beginning on or around September 14, 2010. Six days later, it was announced that Shaquille O'Neal and Apolo Ohno joined Oreo Double Stuf Racing League vets Eli Manning and Venus Williams.</p>
<p>In April 2011, Oreo announced its special edition Oreo cookies with blue creme in promotion of the 2011 3D computer animated film Rio. The promotion included stickers inside each package of cookies. Two types of contests were also announced: first, by completing an album of stickers, consumers could win three movie passes and medium snack bar combos; second, by finding winning stickers in packages with prizes, including a trip to Rio de Janeiro, backpacks, cinema passes for a year, and 3D glasses. The promotion ended May 30, 2011,</p>
<p>In June 2012, Oreo posted an ad displaying an Oreo cookie with rainbow colored cream to commemorate Gay Pride month. The Gay Pride ad was followed during 2012 by a series of ads commemorating other holidays and events, including a red, white and blue cream Oreo for Bastille Day, a stream of cookie crumbs for the appearance of the Delta Aquarid meteor shower, and a cookie with a jagged bite taken out of it for Shark Week.</p>
<h2>International distribution </h2>
<p>Oreo cookies are distributed worldwide through a variety of sales and marketing means. In the United Kingdom, since May 2008, following stocking of Oreo (called Oreo biscuits in UK</p>
<h2>Production </h2>
<p>According to a statement from Kim McMiller, an Associate Director of Consumer Relations,[citation needed] a two-stage process is used to make Oreo cookies. The base cake dough is formed into the familiar round cookies by a rotary mold at the entrance of a 300-foot-long oven. Much of current Oreo production is done at the Kraft/Nabisco factory in Richmond, Virginia. Oreo cookies for the Asian markets are manufactured in Indonesia, India and China, except for Japan where Oreo was manufactured locally under the brand "Yamazaki-Nabisco". Oreo cookies for Europe are made in Spain and in Ukraine for consumers in several CIS countries. Oreo cookies sold in Australia are manufactured in Indonesia (previously China) or Spain, depending on flavor. The Canadian produced version (sold under the Christie's brand) includes coconut oil and is sold only in that region. Manufacturing of Oreo biscuits in Pakistan began in early 2014 at the production plant of Continental Biscuits Limited in Sukkur, Pakistan in collaboration with Mondelez International of the United States and Continental Biscuits Limited of Pakistan.</p>
<p>Oreo factory is moving to Mexico to increase profits. Nabisco's parent company made a $3.92 billion profit in 2013. The move will cause a loss of 600 U.S. jobs and a small boycott. http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-nabisco-mondelez-plant-0730-biz-20150729-story.html https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondel%C4%93z_International</p>
<h2>Varieties </h2>
<p>In addition to their traditional design of two chocolate wafers separated by a cream filling, Oreo cookies have been produced in many different varieties since they were first introduced, and this list is only a guide to some of the more notable and recent types; not all are available in every country. Notable flavors in the US are:</p>
<h2>Use as an ethnic slur </h2>
<p>The term "Oreo" has been used to refer to a black person who acts in a "white manner", or who perpetuates the "un-level playing field for blacks" - someone who is, like the cookie, "black on the outside and white on the inside".</p>
