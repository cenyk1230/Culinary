<h1>Smörgåstårta</h1>
<p>Smörgåstårta (English: "sandwich-cake" or "sandwich gateau") is a Scandinavian cuisine dish that is popular in Sweden, Estonia (as "võileivatort") and Finland (as "voileipäkakku"). This savoury cake is compositionally similar to a sandwich, but it has such a large amount of filling that it more resembles a layered cream cake with garnished top.</p>
<p>The smörgåstårta is normally made up of several layers of white or light rye bread with creamy fillings in between. The fillings and toppings vary, but egg and mayonnaise are often the base, additional filling may vary greatly but often includes one or more of the following: liver pâté, olives, shrimp, ham, various cold cuts, caviar, tomato, cucumber, grapes, lemon slices, cheese and smoked salmon.</p>
<p>Smörgåstårta is served cold and sliced like a dessert cake. The types of sandwich cakes vary from meat, fish, combinations of cheeses and meats to vegan. The smörgåstårta top decor often reflects the ingredients used as a filling. Voileipäkakku (in Finnish) is part of family gathering dishes from birthday parties, weddings or funerals in Finland.</p>
<p>Smörgåstårta was invented by the Swedish pastry chef Göran Gunnarsson in 1965.</p>
