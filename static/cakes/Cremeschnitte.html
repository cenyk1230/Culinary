<h1>Cremeschnitte</h1>
<p>A cremeschnitte (Bosnian: krempita, Croatian: kremšnita, Polish: kremówka, Serbian: кремпита/krempita, Slovak: Krémeš, Slovene: Kremna rezina, Romanian: cremșnit or crempita, Hungarian: krémes) is a vanilla and custard cream cake dessert popular in several central-European countries. There are many regional variations, but they all include puff pastry base and custard cream.</p>
<p>In Croatia, two most popular variants are Samoborska kremšnita from the town of Samobor and Zagrebačka kremšnita from the capital, Zagreb. The extremely popular Samoborska kremšnita is characterized by having a puff pastry top, predominantly custard cream filling (less whipped cream) and is finished with powdered sugar. Zagrebačka kremšnita has a characteristic chocolate icing instead of the puff pastry top, while maintaining the puff pastry base. The classic recipe for Samoborska kremšnita is considered to be designed by Đuro Lukačić in the early 1950es, based on different earlier variants found in patisseries of Zagreb.</p>
<p>In Slovenia, kremna rezina is commonly associated with the town of Bled, an Alpine tourist destination in northwestern Slovenia. The recipe cake was brought to the local Hotel Park in 1953 by Ištvan Kovačevič, chef of the hotel's confectionery store. He came to Bled from Serbia where a similar cake was already known. As of October 2009, 10 million cream cakes have been baked at the hotel's patisserie since its invention. The name of the dessert means simply "cream slice". Most locals refer to it as kremšnita, from the German word Cremeschnitte, with the same meaning.</p>
<p>In Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro, the dish is known as krempita 'cream pie'. It is usually prepared with puff pastry dough. The filling is usually pure thick custard, less commonly combined with meringue (whipped egg whites and sugar) creme. A similar recipe with only meringue filling is called Šampita.</p>
