<h1>Tarte Tatin</h1>
<p>The tarte Tatin (French pronunciation:​[taʁt tatɛ̃]) is an upside-down pastry in which the fruit (usually apples) are caramelized in butter and sugar before the tart is baked.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>Research shows that the tarte Tatin was created accidentally at the Hotel Tatin in Lamotte-Beuvron, France, about 100 miles (160km) south of Paris, in the 1880s. However, whatever the veracity of this story, the concept of the "upside down tarts" was not a new one. For instance, patissier M. A. Carême already mentions glazed gâteaux renversés adorned with apples from Rouen or other fruit in his "Pâtissier Royal Parisien" (1841).</p>
<p>The tarte became a signature dish of the Hôtel Tatin. Historians and gourmets have argued, whether it is a genuine creation of the Demoiselles (sisters) Tatin, or the branding of an improved version of the "tarte solognote", a traditional dish named after the Sologne region which surrounds Lamotte-Beuvron. Research suggests that, while the tarte became a specialty of the Hôtel Tatin, the sisters did not set out to create a "signature dish"; they never wrote a cookbook or published their recipe; they never even called it tarte Tatin. That recognition was bestowed upon them by Curnonsky, the famous French author and epicure, as well as the Parisian restaurant Maxim's after the sisters' deaths.</p>
<p>One of the legends has it that Louis Vaudable, the owner of Maxim's, once tasted it and was smitten. As he described it:</p>
<p>"I used to hunt around Lamotte-Beuvron in my youth and had discovered, in a very small hotel run by elderly ladies, a marvelous dessert listed on the menu under tarte solognote; I questioned the kitchen staff about its recipe, but was sternly rebuffed. Undaunted, I got myself hired as a gardener, but three days later, I was fired when it became clear that I could hardly plant a cabbage; however this was long enough to pierce the secrets of the kitchen; I brought the recipe back and put it on my own menu under 'tarte des demoiselles Tatin'."</p>
<p>In reality, Mr. Vaudable was born in 1902; the sisters retired in 1906 and died in 1911 and 1917; whereas Maxim's was purchased by the Vaudable family in 1932.</p>
<h2>Ingredients </h2>
<p>Originally, the tarte Tatin was made with two regional apple varieties: Reine des Reinettes (King of the Pippins), and Calville. Over the years, other varieties have tended to displace them, including Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, and Gala. When choosing apples for a tarte Tatin, it is important to pick some that will hold their shape while cooking, and not melt into apple sauce. In North America, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, or Jonathan are excellent choices.</p>
<p>Tarte Tatin can also be made with pears, peaches, pineapple, tomatoes, other fruit, or vegetables, such as onion.</p>
<p>In terms of dough the tarte Tatin can be made with both puff pastry or shortcrust pastry.</p>
<h2>Variations </h2>
<p>Variations of this recipe can also be made as turnovers, where the pastry is not only cooked upside-down, but also inverted.</p>
