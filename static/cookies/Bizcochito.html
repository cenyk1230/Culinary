<h1>Bizcochito</h1>
<p>Bizcochito or biscochito is a crisp lard or butter based cookie flavored with cinnamon of what was then known as Santa Fe de Nuevo MÃ©xico. The recipe for making the cookie has been greatly influenced not only by local and indigenous customs, but also by recipes brought to New Mexico by immigrants from other Hispanic countries.</p>
<p>It is served during special celebrations, such as wedding receptions, baptisms, and religious holidays (especially during the Christmas season).]</p>
<h2>State cookie </h2>
<p>In 1989, the U.S. State of New Mexico made the biscochito or bizcochito its official state cookie. It was chosen to help maintain traditional home-baked cookery.</p>
