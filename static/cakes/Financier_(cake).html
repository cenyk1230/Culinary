<h1>Financier (cake)</h1>
<p>A financier is a small French cake. The financier is light and moist, similar to sponge cake, and usually contains almond flour, crushed or ground almonds, or almond flavoring. The distinctive feature of the recipe is beurre noisette.</p>
<p>The name financier is said to derive from the traditional rectangular mold, which resembles a bar of gold.</p>
<p>Financier pans are traditionally rectangular, but other shapes are not uncommon.</p>
