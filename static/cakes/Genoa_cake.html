<h1>Genoa cake</h1>
<p>Genoa cake (also simply Genoa</p>
<p>Although the name genoa cake is mainly used in the UK, it is a variant of the Pandolce cake which originated in 16th century Genoa as a Christmas cake. Unlike genoa, traditional Pandolce includes pine nuts as a major ingredient and uses yeast as its raising agent, which requires several hours to rise, like bread.</p>
<p>The term Genoa cake is also sometimes used to refer to GÃ©noise cake which is a light sponge cake without fruit.</p>
