<h1>Muffin</h1>
<p>A muffin is an individual sized quick bread product. Muffins in America are similar to a cupcakes in size and cooking methods. These can come in both savory varieties, such as corn or cheese muffins, or sweet varieties such as blueberry or banana.</p>
<p>Outside the United Kingdom, an English Muffin is a flatter disk-shaped bread of English origin. These muffins are popular in Commonwealth countries and the United States.</p>
<h2>Quick bread muffins</h2>
<p>Recipes for quick bread muffins are common in 19th-century American cookbooks.</p>
<h2>English muffin</h2>
<p>The English muffin is a type of yeast-leavened bread; generally about 4in (10cm) round and 1.5in (3.8cm) tall. Rather than being oven-baked, they are cooked in a griddle on the stove top and flipped from side-to-side, which results in their typical flattened shape rather than the rounded top seen in baked rolls or cake-type muffins.</p>
<p>The name is first found in print in 1703, spelled moofin;</p>
<p>This photo is a sequence showing the preparation of an English muffin based on a recipe by Alton Brown in The Muffin Man episode of the television cooking show Good Eats.</p>

<h2>Muffin cups</h2>
<p>Muffin cups or cases are usually round sheets of paper, foil, or silicone with scallop-pressed edges, giving the muffin a round cup shape. They are used in the baking of muffins to line the bottoms of muffin tins, to facilitate the easy removal of the finished muffin from the tin.</p>
<p>The advantage to cooks is easier removal and cleanup, more precise form, and moister muffins; however, using them will prevent a crust from forming.</p>
<p>A variety of sizes for muffin cases are available. Slightly different sizes are considered "standard" in different countries. Miniature cases are commonly 1 to 1.25in (25 to 32mm) in diameter at the base and .75in (19mm) tall. Standard-size cases range from 1.75 to 2 inches (44 to 51mm) in diameter at the base and are 1.25 to 1.5in (32 to 38mm) tall. Some jumbo-size cases can hold more than twice the size of standard cases. Australian and Swedish bakers are accustomed to taller paper cases with a larger diameter at the top than American and British bakers.</p>
