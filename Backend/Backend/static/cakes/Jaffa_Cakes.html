<h1>Jaffa Cakes</h1>
<p>Jaffa Cakes are biscuit-sized cakes introduced by McVitie and Price in the UK in 1927 and named after Jaffa oranges. The most common form of Jaffa Cakes are circular, 21‚ÅÑ2 inches (64mm) in diameter and have three layers: a Genoise sponge base, a layer of orange flavoured jelly and a coating of chocolate.</p>
<p>Because McVitie's did not trademark the name "Jaffa Cakes", other biscuit manufacturers and supermarkets have made similar products under the same name.</p>
<h2>Manufacture</h2>
<p>McVitie's entire line of Jaffa Cakes are produced in the United Kingdom at the McVitie's factory in Stockport.</p>
<h2>Flavour variants</h2>
<p>Although Jaffa Cakes are usually orange flavour, limited edition flavours have been available, such as lemon-and-lime,</p>
<h2>Categorisation as cake or biscuit for VAT</h2>
<p>In the United Kingdom, value added tax is payable on chocolate-covered biscuits, but not on chocolate-covered cakes.</p>
<p>The court found in favour of McVities and ruled that the product should be considered a cake, meaning that VAT is not paid on Jaffa Cakes in the United Kingdom.</p>
