<h1>Maple leaf cream cookies</h1>
<p>Maple leaf cream cookies (also called "maple leaf creme cookies", "maple leaf cookies", "maple creme cookies", "maple leaf cremes", and "maple cremes") are a Canadian sandwich cookie.</p>
<p>The cream filling is maple-flavored, and may contain real maple syrup. The cookies are shaped like a maple leaf, a national symbol of Canada.</p>
<p>Several Canadian companies produce it mostly for the domestic market, although it has a growing following in the U.S.</p>
