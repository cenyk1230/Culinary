<h1>Marie biscuit</h1>
<p>A Marie is a type of sweet biscuit similar to a Rich tea biscuit. While the Rich tea biscuit is the most popular version of this biscuit in the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man, it is the Marie version that is most popular in most other countries, particularly Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Portugal, Spain, Ukraine, Mexico, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Mauritius, Nepal, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Egypt.</p>
<h2>Description </h2>
<p>The biscuit is round and usually has its name embossed upon its top surface, the edges of which are also embossed with an intricate design. It is made with wheat flour, sugar, palm oil or sunflower seed oil and, unlike the Rich tea biscuit, is typically vanilla flavoured. In Norway it is labelled "Palm oil free" (Uten palmeolje).</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>The Marie biscuit was created by the London bakery Peek Freans in 1874 to commemorate the marriage of the Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia to the Duke of Edinburgh.</p>
<h2>Consumption </h2>
<p>Like the Rich tea biscuit, many consider the Marie's plain flavour particularly suitable for dunking in tea. Other popular methods of consuming the biscuit includes using two to make a sandwich with butter and marmite or condensed milk spread in between; covering it with golden syrup; or crumbling it up in custard and jelly (gelatin dessert). Marie biscuits are frequently served to children, and infants who may be served the biscuits softened in milk as their first solid food. Marie biscuits are also a common ingredient in home baking recipes. In Spain, natillas custard is typically served with a Maria on it. In Uruguay they are served filled with Dulce de Leche, and sprinkled with shredded coconut. In Ireland, they are known as Marietta and manufactured by Jacob's.</p>
