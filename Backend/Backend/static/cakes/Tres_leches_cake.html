<h1>Tres leches cake</h1>
<p>A tres leches cake (Spanish: pastel de tres leches or torta de tres leches), also known as pan tres leches ("three milks bread"), is a sponge cake—in some recipes, a butter cake—soaked in three kinds of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy cream.</p>
<p>When butter is not used, the Tres Leches is a very light cake, with many air bubbles. This distinct texture is why it does not have a soggy consistency, despite being soaked in a mixture of three types of milk.</p>
<h2>Popularity and origins </h2>
<p>The cake is popular in Central and South America, North America and many parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<h2>Variations </h2>
<p>A variety of tres leches known as trileçe has recently become popular in Turkey. One theory is that the popularity of Brazilian soap operas in Albania led local chefs to reverse engineer the dessert, which then spread to Turkey.</p>
