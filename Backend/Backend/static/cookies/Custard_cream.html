<h1>Custard cream</h1>
<p>A custard cream is a type of biscuit popular in the British Isles. Its structure is that of a sandwich, with a creamy, custard-flavoured centre between two flat biscuit layers. Traditionally, the filling was buttercream (which is still used in home-made recipes) but nowadays cheaper fats have replaced butter in mass-produced biscuits. The filling tastes of vanilla and as such is more akin to the taste of custard made with custard powder than egg custard. It is believed that the custard cream biscuit originated in 1908.</p>
<p>
Some British supermarkets produce own brand versions, with variations including lemon, orange, chocolate, strawberry, coffee and coconut flavours. In a 2007 poll of 7,000 British people, 9 out of 10 voted custard creams to be their favourite biscuit.</p>
<h2>World record </h2>
<p>The largest custard cream in the world, certified by Guinness World Records, was created in November 2010, by amateur biscuit master Simon Morgan and chef supremo Paul Thacker, at Chino Latino's restaurant in Park Plaza, Nottingham, England.</p>
