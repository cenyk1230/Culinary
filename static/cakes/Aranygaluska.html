<h1>Arany galuska</h1>
<p>Arany Galushka (or Aranygaluska) is a traditional Hungarian dessert consisting of balls of yeast dough (galuska). The balls are rolled in melted butter, and then rolled in a mixture of sugar and crushed nuts (traditionally, walnuts), assembled into layers and sprinkled with raisins, before being baked till golden. Arany means gold or golden; galuska refers to the dumpling nature of the balls of dough. Aranygaluska may be served with vanilla custard.</p>
<p>Nancy Reagan popularized this dish in the United States when she served it at the White House for Christmas. </p>
