<h1>Bundt cake</h1>
<p>A Bundt cake /b ånt/ is a cake that is baked in a Bundt pan, shaping it into a distinctive ring shape. The shape is inspired by a traditional European cake known as Gugelhupf, but Bundt cakes are not generally associated with any single recipe. The style of mold in North America was popularized in the 1950s and 60s, after cookware manufacturer Nordic Ware trademarked the name "Bundt" and began producing Bundt pans from cast aluminum. Publicity from Pillsbury saw the cakes gain widespread popularity.</p>
<h2>Etymology </h2>
<p>The Bundt cake derives in part from a European brioche-like cake called Gugelhupf which was particularly popular among Jewish communities in parts of Germany, Austria and Poland.</p>
<p>Opinions differ as to the significance of the word Bund. One possibility is that it means "bunch" or "bundle", and refers to the way the dough is bundled around the tubed center of the pan.</p>
<p>Uses of the word "bund" to describe cakes outside of Europe can be found in Jewish-American cookbooks from around the start of the 20th century.</p>
<h2>Design </h2>
<p>Bundt cakes do not conform to any single recipe; instead their characterizing feature is their shape. A Bundt pan generally has fluted or grooved sides, but its most defining design element is the central tube or "chimney" which leaves a cylindrical hole through the center of the cake. The design means that more of the mixture touches the surface of the pan than in a simple round pan, helping to provide faster and more even heat distribution during cooking.]</p>
<p>Since the name "Bundt" is a trademark, similar pans are often sold as "fluted tube pans" or given other similar descriptive titles.</p>
<h2>Rise to popularity </h2>
<p>The people credited with popularizing the Bundt cake are American businessman H. David Dalquist and his brother Mark S. Dalquist[citation needed], who co-founded cookware company Nordic Ware based in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. In the late 1940s,</p>
<p>Initially, the Bundt pan sold so poorly that Nordic Ware considered discontinuing it.</p>
<p>To date more than 60 million Bundt pans have been sold by Nordic Ware across North America.</p>
