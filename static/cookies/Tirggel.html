<h1>Tirggel</h1>
<p>Tirggel are traditional Christmas biscuits from Zürich, Switzerland. Made from flour and honey, they are thin, hard, and sweet.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>Tirggel-like honey cakes were already popular in antiquity. The earliest known baking moulds for similar pastries date to 3rd millennium BC Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Tirggel are first recorded in Zürich as Dirgel in 1461. They have been manufactured there ever since with elaborately carved wooden moulds depicting Biblical or regional themes.</p>
<h2>Preparation </h2>
<p>Tirggel dough is composed of flour, 29 percent honey,</p>
<p>The dough is pressed very thinly into elaborately carved moulds of varying shapes and sizes; the tirggel can be as large as windowpanes.</p>
<h2>Consumption </h2>
<p>Because tirggel are hard and dry, they are best when sucked on for a while, which allows the honey flavour to become more pronounced.</p>
<p>Tirggel are also very durable. Swiss writer Emanuel Stickelberger reported in 1939 that "the tirggel has the admirable quality of not becoming stale, and the harder it gets, the more enjoyable is it to nibble on."</p>
