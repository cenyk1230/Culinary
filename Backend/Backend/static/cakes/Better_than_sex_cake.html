<h1>Better than sex cake</h1>
<p>Better than sex cake, also known as Is It Really Better Than Sex? Cake or Better than Robert Redford cake, Some versions of the recipe are very similar to an upside-down cake. The cake's origins are unknown and recipes exist from the 1980s, but the recipe received a surge in popularity after Paula Deen featured the dessert on her series Paula's Home Cooking.</p>
<p>The cake's moist center is typically created by inserting a fork into the cake several times and filling the holes with a mixture containing sugar and a flavoring or fruit such as pineapple.</p>
