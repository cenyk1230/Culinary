<h1>Cavallucci</h1>
<p>Cavallucci are a rich Italian Christmas pastry made with anise, almonds, candied fruits, coriander, and flour. They are Sienese in origin, and the name translates approximately to "little horses." The chewy biscuits traditionally use Tuscan millefiori honey as an essential ingredient in the paste.</p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>The cookies were originally imprinted with the image of a horse (cavalli is the Italian term for horses).</p>
<p>Many theories are associated with the origin of its name. According to the most popular version of the story, cavallucci were served to travelers on horseback as a source of nourishment for long trips.</p>
<h2>Serving </h2>
<p>The pastry is often paired with sweet dessert wines, such as Vin Santo, and dipped into the wine before being eaten.</p>
