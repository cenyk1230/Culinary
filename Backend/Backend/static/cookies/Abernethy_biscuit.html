<h1>Abernethy biscuit</h1>
<p>The Abernethy biscuit was invented by doctor John Abernethy in the 18th century as a digestive improver and hence aid to health.</p>
<p>Abernethy believed that most diseases were due to disorders in digestion. The Abernethy biscuit is a type of digestive biscuit, a baked good originally designed to be eaten as a support to proper digestion.</p>
<p>The Abernethy biscuit is an adaptation of the plain captainâ€™s biscuit or hardtack, with the added ingredients of sugar (for energy), and caraway seeds because of their reputation for having a carminative effect</p>
<p>Abernethy biscuits remain popular in Scotland. They are manufactured commercially by Simmers (Edinburgh), Walls Bakeries (Shetland Islands), and by Stag Bakeries (Isle of Lewis).</p>
