<h1>Krumkake</h1>
<p>Krumkake or Krum kaka (/ˈkruːmkɑːkə/; meaning bent or curved cake, plural krumkaker) is a Norwegian waffle cookie Like Italian pizzelle, a special decorative two-sided iron griddle, similar to a waffle iron, is traditionally used to bake the thin round cakes. Older irons are used over the stove, but modern electric irons offer the convenience of nonstick surfaces, automatic timing, and multiple cakes per batch. While hot, the 13–20cm krumkake are rolled into small cones around a wooden or plastic cone form. Krumkake can be eaten plain or filled with whipped cream (often multekrem) or other fillings.</p>
<p>These cookies are popular not only in Norway but also among Norwegian immigrant descendants in the American Midwest. Krumkaker are traditionally made in preparation for Christmas, along with other Norwegian sweets including Sandbakelse and Rosettes. They offer a sweet dessert after the traditional Christmas Eve dinner of ribs or pinnekjøtt.</p>
<p>In Germany, the cookies are commonly filled with sweet stuffings. They are also used as a type of ice cream cone.</p>
