<h1>Red bean cake</h1>
<p>Red bean cake is a type of Asian cake with a sweet red bean paste filling. It is made primarily with azuki beans.</p>
<h2>Japanese cuisine </h2>
<p>Mizuyokan (Japan) is made without the outer shell of the beans, and instead of a paste, the mashed beans are mixed with gelatin, cooled for an extended period of time, and then cut into squares and served.</p>
<h2>Cantonese cuisine </h2>
<p>Cantonese-style red bean cake is made with hardened red bean paste that has been frozen. The cake is sweetened and sprinkled with sesames. It is generally tough to bite, and is served as a square block. Depending on the particular region within China, this may be seen as a year-round snack, or as a seasonal pastry consumed on certain traditional Chinese holidays.</p>
