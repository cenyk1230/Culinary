<h1>Prinzregententorte</h1>
<p>Prinzregententorte is a Bavarian torte, which consists of at least six, mostly seven, thin layers of sponge cake interlaid with chocolate buttercream and a topping of apricot jam upon the very last. The exterior is covered in a dark chocolate glaze.</p>
<p>The Prinzregententorte is very popular in Bavaria, available in cake shops all year round.</p>
<h2>Origin </h2>
<p>The cake is named after Prince Regent Luitpold, who was prince regent of Bavaria beginning in 1886. Its exact origin remains in dispute; among those claimed as its creators are the prince regent's cook, Johann Rottenhoeffer, the baker Anton Seidl, and the baking firm of Heinrich Georg Erbsh√§user.</p>
<h2>Recipe </h2>
<p>Typically, the cake consists of very thin layers of sponge cake, each approximately 25 centimetres (9.8in) in diameter, with chocolate buttercream on each side. Apricot jam may be added to the topmost layer, and the whole cake is covered in dark chocolate.</p>
