<h1>Piñata cookie</h1>
<p>A piñata cookie is a sugar cookie that is shaped and colored like a piñata and filled with various ingredients.</p>
<p>Common ingredients in the dough's preparation include flour, vegetable oil, butter, sugar, powdered sugar, eggs, cream of tartar, vanilla, salt, food coloring and baking soda.</p>
<p>The piñata cookie has been described as being invented by Sandra Denneler. However, it's possible that versions have been created prior to this.</p>
<p>Similar desserts with a piñata-style filling include cakes, cupcakes and ice cream cones.</p>
